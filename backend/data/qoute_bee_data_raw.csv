Contentment comes from a deeper place. You’re at peace with what the Almighty has bestowed on you, no matter what your circumstances. You trust Him fully"
1,2022-07-06 11:15:50+00:00,muftimenk,"You become what you constantly think about. If you think you can’t, you probably won’t make it. If you think you’re a failure, you’ll end up not doing anything significant in life. If you think negative thoughts always, you’ll end up with negative results. Guard your thoughts."
2,2022-07-05 19:00:04+00:00,muftimenk,Do remember that not everything about you is meant to be disclosed to everyone. Keep private things private. Be discerning. It will keep you from a ton of trouble and disappointment in the end.
3,2022-07-04 21:21:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Complaining to others and stressing over our problems will not solve them. The Almighty knows the best solutions to our problems. We just need to trust Him, seek His assistance and not anyone else.  Keep asking Him. He will respond."
4,2022-07-04 04:36:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Delays, disappointment and detours are all part of the Almighty’s Plan. You have to understand that. Valuable lessons will be taught along the way. You should try to learn as many of them. Not only will you emerge stronger, you’ll also be grateful for all He’s put you through."
5,2022-07-03 05:06:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't feel ashamed when giving little for charity because there is always goodness in giving, no matter how small the act. The Almighty sees and knows. That’s what matters."
6,2022-07-02 18:13:16+00:00,muftimenk,"You might think the battle is too big for you. You’re overwhelmed by the cares &amp; stresses of life but remember, it’s nothing to the Lord of the Worlds. Nothing is impossible for Him. Hand it over to Him &amp; see how things unfold. He will take care of all that we cannot. Have faith."
7,2022-07-02 09:04:13+00:00,muftimenk,"The choices you make are yours. You don’t need to explain yourself to anyone. But a lot of us feel this need to explain ourselves. Perhaps we want to be liked by everyone. Or to fit in. Whatever it is, stick to your decisions. If you think you’re wrong, correct them."
8,2022-07-01 16:27:56+00:00,muftimenk,The truth is nobody will truly understand what you’re going through except the Almighty. He’s the only One who knows your true circumstances and is always available when you need Him. He will heal you and make you whole again.
9,2022-07-01 07:33:24+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. You’re the Turner of Hearts. You heal us in a moment. You forgive in an instant. You make the impossible a reality. May we always be ever grateful for everything You’ve bestowed on us. Aameen.
10,2022-06-30 20:51:11+00:00,muftimenk,Your heart whispers many things daily. Not many of them end up in your prayers. But trust Him. He knows what you need and He won't disappoint.
11,2022-06-30 14:28:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Never tire of doing good, even small acts. We often hear people say that no one notices any of the good they do. But the Almighty does. He’s All-Knowing. So press on &amp; do as much as you can. Good deeds are often magnified &amp; the rewards multiplied."
12,2022-06-29 22:19:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste the most blessed days. Ten days is not a long time so be sure to fill your days with as much good as possible. The Almighty gives us these periods of spiritual boosts throughout the year. So purify your intent, make a plan and you’re on the way to accomplish much."
13,2022-06-28 21:59:02+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all been through rough days, a difficult month or a bad year. But these are often blessings in disguise. Remember, everything the Almighty does is good. We only have to wait patiently, hold our head up and press on. Let life take its course."
14,2022-06-28 00:43:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t wait to forgive someone till they apologise. You may end up waiting forever. Remember, it’s easy to hold a grudge and it’s easy to lay blame. But by doing so, you’re allowing others to have power over you.  For the sake of closure and healing, you should forgive &amp; move on."
15,2022-06-26 19:20:27+00:00,muftimenk,Some people refuse to accept the fact that you’ve changed for the better. They keep harping on the “old” you. They refuse to see you in a new light. They can’t stop talking about your past mistakes and wrongs. Ignore such people. Time to move on.
16,2022-06-26 12:12:01+00:00,muftimenk,"As humans, you expect the Almighty to answer your prayers in the way you thought was good for you. But He’s All-Knowing and may not bring you what you thought, the way you thought, but what He has planned for you will be bigger &amp; better. Something you wouldn’t have imagined."
17,2022-06-26 04:57:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, people will only drive you crazy if you allow them. So don't let your anger spin out of control. If someone is irritating you, recognise those feelings and then let them go without saying much or getting into conflict. You don’t need to respond to everything."
18,2022-06-25 16:34:02+00:00,muftimenk,The evil eye is real and should not be taken lightly. Most people are negligent in protecting themselves and do not worry about showing off their blessings; posting every detail of their life on social media. Know that not everyone who sees your story will be happy for you.
19,2022-06-25 10:02:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful about giving your heart fully to someone other than the Almighty. Everyone can hurt you but only He can heal you. So be wise, have realistic expectations and protect your heart as best you can from those who are too quick to profess their love for you."
20,2022-06-24 17:16:16+00:00,muftimenk,"When something doesn’t feel right, don’t do it, leave it, walk away from it. Trust your judgement, your intuition, your feeling. It’s the Almighty’s way of guiding you and steering you away from what’s not right. You don’t owe anyone any explanation. Just do it."
21,2022-06-24 06:46:18+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask for strength as we feel weak and tired from the affairs of the world. Help us to carry on in the face of adversity and whatever trials You send our way. Grant us patience and help us go through it with full faith and confidence. Aameen.
22,2022-06-23 17:01:38+00:00,muftimenk,One of the best and bravest decisions you’ll ever make is to finally let go of people who are bad for your spiritual health. Keep your heart and soul attached to the Almighty.
23,2022-06-23 06:50:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop overthinking. Stop feeding your mind negative thoughts and  self doubt. Love yourself enough and remember, the Almighty only wants the best for you."
24,2022-06-22 21:44:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Patience is not easy. It’s  not for the fainthearted. That’s why the rewards are so great. It can break you, wreck you, makes you want to scream and give up but you press on because you know what the Almighty loves. He is always with the patient."
25,2022-06-22 06:19:27+00:00,muftimenk,Many people get upset when their work is not acknowledged. Don’t. The Almighty knows what you’ve done and how much effort and sacrifice went into it. Isn’t that the best acknowledgment one could ever wish for?
26,2022-06-21 17:07:18+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t quit today. You’ve come this far. What you think is the worst is never the worst. Hold on tight because your biggest battles will end soon. Great breakthroughs will follow. The Almighty is always on your side whether or not you realize it. Trust Him.
27,2022-06-21 06:56:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Nowadays, many young people hang on to the belief that if it feels good, do it. This simply means you’re allowing yourself to be controlled by your moods, living life according to your feelings. This can be dangerous.  Learn to live a life of faith."
28,2022-06-20 09:54:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyone, including good people will do bad things. That’s the nature of humans. We all have flaws. We all commit sins. Nobody is perfect. But learn from your mistakes and try to become a better person with each passing day. It’s never too late to change."
29,2022-06-19 22:17:05+00:00,muftimenk,Nothing is too small or too big for the Almighty. Just ask Him. He never gets bored listening to your prayer. He loves it when you seek Him.
30,2022-06-19 16:12:15+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what the odds are against you, you'll fight it; not because you have the strength but because your strength comes from the Almighty. Keep asking Him."
31,2022-06-19 07:54:01+00:00,muftimenk,The mind replays what the heart can't delete. So be careful what you keep in your heart. Purify it often with remembrance of the Almighty.
32,2022-06-18 19:21:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't think you’ve made it in life because of your power, position and authority. None of it will last. Nothing in this life will last. So always remain humble and attach your heart to that which matters. Keep the Almighty close and you’ll emerge the winner."
33,2022-06-17 21:37:44+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in angry times. All the sharing on social media makes it worse. Learn to control your innermost urge to retaliate. You don’t have to respond to everything. If you don't slow down when you start to see red, you could do significant damage to your life. Keep the peace."
34,2022-06-17 04:35:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, save us from Your trials and heal the wounds we have been keeping inside for too long. Grant us good patience to go through whatever You send our way. Show us a way out of our difficulties. Keep us firm in faith. Aameen."
35,2022-06-16 21:08:09+00:00,muftimenk,Life is never smooth sailing. We all get knocked down at some stage. The biggest test is how quickly we get back up. We must never stay down for long. Seek the Almighty’s help and you’ll stand up again and start moving forward.
36,2022-06-16 07:21:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste your valuable time with people who have nothing but negativity in them. They criticise everything and everyone in the most damaging ways. Unless you know you can help them, choose to stay away from such toxic people. Do it for your well-being."
37,2022-06-15 18:35:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Some will continue to hate you for no apparent reason. Instead of constructive criticism, they’re out to destroy people with their comments. Show them you’re happy with who you are by doing what you do best. Show them that you’re not affected by their immaturity."
38,2022-06-15 06:27:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Some get a big thrill from boasting about their achievements or showing off their possessions. They believe that they’re better than others. They may even end up pushing people around. That’s wrong. Remember, whatever you have, someone will have more. That’s life. Stay humble."
39,2022-06-14 15:33:09+00:00,muftimenk,"As humans, we love to plan. We plan for today, tommorw, the future. It’s fine to plan. Dream. Hope. Pray for the best. But put your trust in the One who knows you better than you know yourself. And in the process, always remember that the Almighty is the Best of Planners."
40,2022-06-13 22:24:29+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with us is we stress over everything. We want to micromanage and control things. Don’t. The truth is six months from now or even sooner, everything you're stressing about won't even matter. Take things in your stride. Let the Almighty take charge."
41,2022-06-13 11:56:28+00:00,muftimenk,"This world is such that it will break your heart. Without a doubt. In fact, it will even crush it if you allow it. Remember, the Almighty will never leave you in that state. He will fix it. Turn to Him, the Owner of hearts, sincerely and let Him heal you as only He knows how."
42,2022-06-12 20:10:38+00:00,muftimenk,"We all want to fit in. We all want to feel comfortable in our surroundings. But at what cost? There’s a consequence for every action we choose. Surround ourselves with righteous friendships, the kind that provides goodness and the remembrance of the Almighty."
43,2022-06-11 18:34:01+00:00,muftimenk,Not everyone will appreciate what you do for them. Don’t be discouraged because there are many ungrateful people out there. You just have to figure out who’s worth your efforts and who’s just taking advantage of you. Focus your energy on those who matter.
44,2022-06-11 09:25:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes it’s necessary to distance yourself from certain distractions in your life to concentrate your time, energy and effort on things that matter the most. Don’t be afraid to do that. Your true friends will allow you that space and respect you. Go for it."
45,2022-06-10 04:37:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. I trust You through my pain, my suffering, my heartache, my sadness, my confusion, my heedlessness. I know Your Mercy overpowers Your Wrath. That’s why I never lose hope, despite my sins &amp; transgressions, I trust You. I thank You for always being there for me. Aameen."
46,2022-06-09 18:49:02+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to let go of things that went wrong or didn’t work out. Learn from them. That’s life in a nutshell. Keep going. You’ll never win this race of life if you keep looking back. The mistakes you’ve made don’t define who you are today. Think positive that things will get better.
47,2022-06-09 01:11:39+00:00,muftimenk,"In any hardship, don't feel depressed. Ask the Almighty for strength to endure; for at the end of the dark tunnel of despair is HIs reward waiting for you."
48,2022-06-08 18:28:28+00:00,muftimenk,No squabble or argument is worth it. Don’t sacrifice your Hereafter for such pettiness. Make peace with those you've offended and insulted. Move on.
49,2022-06-08 03:06:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be affected by criticism. Positive or negative, take them in your stride. Know that the level of criticism rises with your worth."
50,2022-06-07 07:23:37+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all felt like a failure at times. But don’t drown in that feeling. Remember, the battles you’ve won, the setbacks you’ve overcome, the trials you’ve gone through. The Almighty promised that nothing would last. Keep hope alive &amp; carry on. He’s always watching over you."
51,2022-06-06 23:13:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful how you react to those who’ve wronged you. Two wrongs do not make a right. You can’t be mean, angry or bitter &amp; expect good in return. Don’t wrong others the way they’ve wronged you. Be the better, kinder person always. Your reward is with the Almighty."
52,2022-06-06 12:42:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Once you’ve done your best, leave it to the Almighty. Relax and don’t worry. Trust Him. He has your back. He’s in control. Not you."
53,2022-06-06 05:18:40+00:00,muftimenk,"The closer you get to the Almighty, the more you’ll understand that every trial you’re going through is to get you on track for what’s to come. It may not be obvious now but the picture will emerge when the last piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. Trust Him."
54,2022-06-05 22:49:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Once you’ve built a good relationship with the Almighty, you’ll always be filled with hope and confidence. You’ll  always have good thoughts about Him. You’ll begin to realize that He is greater than any situation you will ever encounter."
55,2022-06-05 13:45:20+00:00,muftimenk,Be on guard always. It’s human nature to judge. But check yourself before you speak or send that nasty message and do any potential harm. You can’t undo what you’ve done. Pause. Try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Put yourself in their shoes.
56,2022-06-05 04:18:13+00:00,muftimenk,"This life is not perfect. The mess you make, the delays, the things you don’t understand, they’re all part of the Almighty’s Plan for you. He’s worked out every bit of the puzzle. Your job is to bear good patience as you go through it. You’ll see the full picture eventually."
57,2022-06-04 19:38:21+00:00,muftimenk,"If you live your life making decisions based on what others will think of you, it’s time for a rethink. If you live your life for others, you’ll never know peace because nothing you do will be good enough. You can’t please everyone."
58,2022-06-04 10:11:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about how people act. That’s on them not you. Always choose kindness, that’s under your control. Spread it far and wide, whichever way you can, even if it means giving a smile or a word of encouragement. Never underestimate how contagious being kind can be."
59,2022-06-04 02:43:01+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let bitterness and resentment take root in your heart. They’re poison which will harm your soul eventually. Let go of the hurt or hate that comes with it. Turn to the Almighty and let Him heal you. Feel whole again with a much lighter heart.
60,2022-06-03 08:23:36+00:00,muftimenk,Choose kindness above all else. Kind people use positivity as a beacon to create more light. That’s because they’ve seen what negativity can do. They make time for others in a world that doesn’t wait for anyone. It takes strength to shake off all the bad and move ahead.
61,2022-06-03 00:56:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You to keep our hearts soft and protect them from hardening. Shower us with Your Mercy, such that when we commit a sin, we feel the guilt that comes with it. Don’t make us among those who sin and yet don’t feel remorseful. Aameen."
62,2022-06-02 16:18:42+00:00,muftimenk,Life can be difficult at times. The never-ending running around &amp; stress to get things done. Don’t let it make you resent life. Learn to look at those who have less than you. Those who would trade places with you at the drop of a hat. Thank the Almighty for everything.
63,2022-06-02 07:41:40+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is no matter how lonely you are, you’re never alone. The Almighty is always near. Very near. He knows what you’re going through. He is aware of everything. So when everyone has abandoned you,  seek comfort in Him, knowing that He is always there."
64,2022-06-01 17:28:58+00:00,muftimenk,"When things get too complicated and you don’t understand what’s going on in your life, keep a heart full of trust and keep moving forward. The Almighty knows! Don’t listen to the naysayers. In time, things will get clearer."
65,2022-06-01 06:12:47+00:00,muftimenk,"If you think it’s one hardship after another and you feel like caving in, think again. The Almighty knows you can handle it. He knows you’re strong. He wants you to remember that difficult battles are only given to strong soldiers."
66,2022-06-01 00:01:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is the online space is getting from bad to worse. People think and type away behind walls of fake names and identity; they think they can get away with it because nobody knows. The truth is the Almighty knows. Remember, you’ll be held accountable for all your actions."
67,2022-05-31 13:53:23+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to say no to people who mess with your head. The ones who keep doing things intentionally to upset you. The ones who always play the victim even though it’s obvious they’re wrong. The ones who expect you to prioritise them but won’t do the same for you. Avoid them.
68,2022-05-31 05:58:18+00:00,muftimenk,You may wake today thinking it’s going to be the most difficult day to get through. But the Almighty knows you’ll get by just fine. The pain will ease and the hurt will pass. It’s because nothing lasts in this world. He has promised better days ahead.
69,2022-05-30 19:38:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop dwelling &amp; brooding over things that haven’t worked out. Accept what happened, acknowledge how you feel about it, then put it behind you and move on. Remember, it’s all part of the Almighty’s Plan. You can’t change the past, but you can surely do something about the future."
70,2022-05-30 11:37:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you know that we judge others because we’re insecure? When we judge, we are often projecting something we don't want to feel about ourselves or something that we feel is missing in our own lives. Think about this the next time you’re tempted to pass judgement."
71,2022-05-29 23:17:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Let it go. The things that have happened in the past, the things that aren’t happening right now, let it go. If you want to move on, stop looking back on your past. That part of your life is over. If you want to see the light, stop holding yourself in the darkness of your past."
72,2022-05-29 06:01:53+00:00,muftimenk,Let’s be honest. This world is full of distractions; too many things vying for our attention. Discipline yourself to focus on what matters. Let go of those things which don’t. Have the “Creator-first” mentality. Don’t just fit Him in. He’s right at the TOP.
73,2022-05-28 18:40:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t look down on others. Remember, we all sin. And we’re all in need of the same forgiveness from the same Creator, who is most Merciful. May the Almighty forgive us all. Aameen."
74,2022-05-28 12:02:49+00:00,muftimenk,"The more successful you are, the more likely people will plot and plan against you. Do your best to protect yourself against them but remember, there’s no power higher than the Almighty. If you have His protection, no one can harm you. Trust only Him."
75,2022-05-28 01:06:38+00:00,muftimenk,Never feel like you have to go it alone. The Almighty is always there in both good and bad times. You’ll never have to face anything on your own as long as you call out to Him. He’s there waiting for you to turn back to Him. Do it today.
76,2022-05-27 14:53:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Never forget that the Almighty is on our side. If we take a single step towards Him, He takes many “steps” towards us! Yes, life is hard &amp; unfortunate things happen. Often we don’t know why they happen. But trust Him &amp; know that He wants  what’s good for us."
77,2022-05-27 04:16:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray that you have Mercy on us; take away the suffering all around us and bring on the recovery. We know there is no cure but Your cure. Heal our hearts and purify our souls so we can feel a strong attachment to You. Aameen."
78,2022-05-26 16:08:33+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is you’re going to be slandered from time to time, so don’t allow it to throw you into emotional turmoil when it happens. If you feel the need to defend yourself against a lie, the best approach is to give yourself time to cool off before reacting calmly."
79,2022-05-26 04:59:40+00:00,muftimenk,"If you find yourself and your conversation focusing on people; what’s going on in their lives, their relationships, their social status etc, then you have a serious problem. You need to get out of that mould; focus on yourself rather than being concerned with others."
80,2022-05-25 18:21:44+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t keep grudges &amp; bad feelings in your heart. It will upset you &amp; weigh you down. It won’t change anything &amp; you’ll end up feeling miserable. Let it all go. Keep your heart light. Let Him take care of it. Your health will improve &amp; your faith in the Almighty will strengthen.
81,2022-05-25 06:39:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyone’s journey is different. Don’t look at someone and make your own assumptions because there  are many who are silently going on with life because they can’t express their pain. The ones who need a break from it all, those who are facing trial after trial. Pray for healing."
82,2022-05-24 20:48:47+00:00,muftimenk,Some love to blame others when things are not going their way. Looking for a scapegoat is easy. Blaming keeps people from having to look at what they did to get into the mess. But it takes real courage to admit fault and show remorse. Only then are we able to grow.
83,2022-05-24 08:37:08+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve wronged someone, don’t try to turn the tables and make yourself the wronged party. You may think you’re getting away with it but the Almighty knows. In fact, you should be afraid because when it all comes back  to you, the truth will come out. He knows best."
84,2022-05-23 18:22:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Your wealth, your children, your beauty, your power should never make you arrogant. Remember, like a bolt from the blue, the Almighty can take everything away. Anytime. But if you want something that lasts, choose humility and kindness."

You’ll feel pain, you’ll get hurt, youll feel broken, you’ll break down. That’s part of the process called life. You’ll be okay in the end."
86,2022-05-23 04:01:32+00:00,muftimenk,"For as long you’re alive, keep hope alive. Hope in the Mercy of the Almighty.

Better days are ahead."

88,2022-05-22 05:48:26+00:00,muftimenk,"There is way too much competition in the world today. Few people want to work together and help each other succeed. Instead, we get envious when others do well. This is wrong. Be happy for others."
89,2022-05-21 15:02:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Every day, we face a lot of pressure to be what society wants of us but life is not made like that. We go through highs &amp; lows; we get tested. That’s the way it is. But when we seek strength from the Almighty, He gives us the courage &amp; what we need to carry on."

91,2022-05-20 22:20:22+00:00,muftimenk,"You know you’ll be tested regularly so how do you react to the challenges of life? Get angry, stressed out &amp; sink into depression or respond with beautiful patience; knowing the Almighty will grant you victory when you put full faith in Him and do your best."
92,2022-05-20 13:29:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty doesn't make mistakes in His Plans. Every hardship you’ve experienced has served to make you the person that you are today. There are valuable lessons in everything that happens to you. Stop asking why it happened and focus on how you should respond."

94,2022-05-20 03:38:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep us steadfast in our prayers and worship done solely for You. Grant us humility and submission always, never showing off or feeling that we’re more pious than the person next to us. Protect us from being arrogant and to never judge others."
95,2022-05-19 20:39:11+00:00,muftimenk,You can’t choose your family. The Almighty has done that for you. So learn to give and take as much as possible. Remind and guide when you can. Remain respectful and keep the peace. It’s not easy. But know that breaking the ties of kinship is a huge sin.
96,2022-05-19 11:43:49+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re going through problem after problem. You keep asking the Almighty. Nothing happens. You’re facing depression, sickness, financial issues, marital problems. Why is He taking so long to respond? He’s aware! You have to trust Him. His planning and timing is perfect."
97,2022-05-19 03:28:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Your faith will be tested again and again. It’s easy to believe when things are going your way, when the path is rosy. But the true test comes when the Almighy puts obstacles in your way. Do you become disobedient &amp; defiant or do you submit to Him, be patient and ride it out?"
98,2022-05-18 20:19:49+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s only human to feel frustrated and dejected when things aren’t going our way. We feel like we’re carrying the weight of the world on our backs. We may think the Almighty is not answering our prayers, but He is answering them; just not the way we want."
99,2022-05-18 07:08:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Hypocrites love to gossip, they love to know what everyone else is doing. They may even make up gossip if it’s not juicy enough. It can be hurtful and upsetting when you are the subject of the untruthful stories. Confront them peacefully and pray for them."
100,2022-05-17 20:03:11+00:00,muftimenk,The real test of sincerity is to see if a person will help you even if he knows he will get nothing in return from you. The truth is anyone can help when there’s something to gain in return; but to help when there’s nothing to be gained shows true love &amp; a beautiful heart.
101,2022-05-17 12:54:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Be prepared to have the most unexpected people let you down. It’s bound to happen at some stage. Amid all this, be yourself and spread goodness as much as possible but don’t expect goodness from everyone."
102,2022-05-17 05:17:23+00:00,muftimenk,"You're human. You don’t have to be strong all the time. You’re allowed to be overwhelmed, sad, cry, fall down and get back up again. The most important thing is not to lose your link with your Maker. He has a reason for everything. You’ll emerge much stronger."
103,2022-05-16 18:08:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Each time we're hurt, we tend to blame others. It's always someone else's fault. Don’t fall into that trap. Learn to be accountable. Take charge of your life and your own shortcomings. The Almighty knows the truth. Don't blame the innocent."
104,2022-05-16 11:42:48+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all felt like a failure at times. But don’t drown in that feeling. Remember, the battles you’ve won, the setbacks you’ve overcome, the trials you’ve gone through. The Almighty promised that nothing would last. Keep hope alive &amp; carry on. He’s always watching over you."
105,2022-05-16 04:24:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Society may not tolerate second chances. It can be unforgiving when you make mistakes. But the Almighty is ever ready to give you a fresh start when you turn back to Him. Whatever you need He has for you: healing, forgiveness and peace. Seek Him for a new beginning."
106,2022-05-15 18:20:48+00:00,muftimenk,Does your heart feel burdened? Do you feel like your life is crumbling? Bad days happen to everyone. Start counting your blessings. Remember that there are so many who would trade places with you. For the life you have. For everything He has blessed you with. Be grateful.
107,2022-05-15 09:02:25+00:00,muftimenk,Losing someone you love is a huge test of faith. That’s the reality of life. How you pick yourself up and carry on shows how much you understand the Almighty’s plan. May He help us cope with our loss and reunite us with our loved ones in Paradise.
108,2022-05-15 01:53:23+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel guilt in your heart after you’ve sinned, be grateful. It’s the Almighty’s way of telling you to repent and do good. He’s offering you a way out after you’ve gone against what He has prescribed. That’s His Mercy."
109,2022-05-14 16:42:54+00:00,muftimenk,It takes a lot of courage to stand alone &amp; be yourself. It takes a lot of courage to be different. It takes a lot of courage to not compromise your faith. Some will try to make you feel like a freak for not standing with the crowd. That’s ok. Listen to your heart.
110,2022-05-14 11:16:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of people who sap the positive energy right out of you, leaving you feeling frustrated, drained &amp; unhappy. Shift your focus from trying to change other people &amp; instead focus on making yourself feel better. Let such people take their negativity elsewhere."
111,2022-05-14 05:58:58+00:00,muftimenk,Some people enjoy slandering others. They do this out of jealousy and envy. Let people judge you by your character. You can’t stop them. Be upright. Be strong. Surely the Almighty is aware of the evil they’re spreading.
112,2022-05-13 20:49:10+00:00,muftimenk,"No one is doomed for as long as you feel remorse after you’ve sinned. As long as you’re seeking forgiveness, the Almighty will forgive you. Satan will tease and taunt you that you’re not worthy of being forgiven. Ignore such thoughts. Never doubt His Mercy."
113,2022-05-13 13:42:24+00:00,muftimenk,"At all times, be fair and just. Even with your enemies and those you strongly dislike. Don't let your emotions, anger or hate get in the way, leading you to behave unfairly. A believer is always balanced and careful. Give others a chance."
114,2022-05-13 13:08:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Sad demise of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed of the UAE. May Allah Almighty forgive his shortcomings and grant him Paradise. Aameen #sheikhkhalifa

115,2022-05-13 06:36:05+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t dwell on critics and haters. Focus on your Creator and His plans for you and your life. Don’t worry about those trying to put you down. Your job is to respect others and not to hurt anyone. Do your best. He’ll do the rest.
116,2022-05-13 00:01:20+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us to understand that life doesn't always go the way we want. You’re the only One who knows what’s best for us. You’re the only One who knows what the future holds. Help us to remain steadfast &amp; face every test with utmost patience. Aameen.
117,2022-05-12 14:21:39+00:00,muftimenk,Satan will try to trick you into believing that you won’t be happy until you get to where YOU think you should be. Learn to be happy with the here and now. Appreciate what’s in front of you to begin with.
118,2022-05-12 08:24:07+00:00,muftimenk,"How do we understand the Almighty’s Plan for us in this confusing journey called life? It boils down to our link with Him. If you’re trying to get close to Him, He will show you the way. Bit by bit, it will unfold and become clearer what He has in store for you. Build that link."
119,2022-05-12 04:06:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Good or bad, what we do in our lives will always come back to us eventually. So if we want goodness all round, stop making life difficult and creating obstacles for others."
120,2022-05-11 21:00:50+00:00,muftimenk,One of the biggest flaws in humans is pretending to be blind to their own shortcomings but they’re the first to jump down someone's throat when others make a mistake. Learn to be more self-critical instead of always pointing fingers.
121,2022-05-11 18:08:16+00:00,muftimenk,We have lost two members of our community in one day. May Allah Almighty grant them the highest ranks of Paradise and make it easy for their loved ones. Aameen
122,2022-05-11 02:50:31+00:00,muftimenk,We all want happiness. So be grateful when blessed. Be patient when facing trials. Repent and seek forgiveness. Do these consistently. Watch your life change.
123,2022-05-10 20:03:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever the Almighty has decreed for you, no one can stop. Whatever’s meant for you will be yours.  There is no need to worry about it. It will come to you. Remain steadfast."
124,2022-05-10 02:42:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Trust people by all means but don’t go overboard. Remember, there’s no guarantee in life; even the closest people around you may go against you. But as long as you have the Almighty with you, He will never let you down. Have patience and you’ll reap the reward."
125,2022-05-09 19:24:22+00:00,muftimenk,Being at peace is everything. It’s not just a feeling. It’s a way of life. It shows in everything that you do. It shows how close you are to the One who made you. It shows you’ve surrendered to the Almighty. You accept everything that He has decreed. It’s the most powerful thing.
126,2022-05-09 12:56:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay clear of the herd mentality. Why should you do it just because everyone else is doing it? There’s no need to fit in. Let society say you’re the odd one out. Remember, at the end of the day, it’s better to walk alone than with a crowd headed in the wrong direction."
127,2022-05-08 20:50:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people can be very difficult to deal with. They will hurt you with their words and actions. It’s easy to just be angry and shut them out of your lives. But at times you can’t. They may be family members. Remember, they are a test from the Almighty. Will you be patient?"
128,2022-05-08 10:52:11+00:00,muftimenk,"We tend to complain too much. Our job is too difficult. Our parents are too demanding. Our children are too mischievous. Chronic complaining never makes anything better, it saps your energy &amp; the energy of those around you. Look for the positives. You’ll be a much happier person."
129,2022-05-07 14:33:15+00:00,muftimenk,The bottom line is you really can’t count on people to motivate you and build you up in life. The truth is everyone is so caught up in  their own lives that they have little or no time for others. Learn to encourage yourself but don’t leave the Almighty out of the equation.
130,2022-05-07 04:55:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever a door closes in your life, the Almighty wants you to move on. Move forward. Don’t look back. He’s guiding your steps. You’ve got to trust Him. Change is never easy. The unknown can be unsettling. But He’s the Owner  of your sustenance; so why worry?"
131,2022-05-06 21:31:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Think well of others and see what it does to your heart. Each time you hear something bad about someone, don’t spread it, give him the benefit of the doubt. Put yourself in his position. Protect yourself from worrisome thoughts that disturb your mind. Keep the peace."
132,2022-05-06 04:39:32+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Thank You for guiding us during an intense month of worship. Thank You for being there when we felt lost. Thank You for shining Your light when we felt afraid of the dark &amp; for carrying us through when we thought we couldn't make it. Aameen.
133,2022-05-05 18:17:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, Satan always wants us to feel despair. The Almighty doesn’t. He knows we are weak. That’s why if we show Him that we’re sincere in our efforts to get close to Him, He will guide us back and He will surely forgive us. He is the Most Merciful."
134,2022-05-05 09:56:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything is the way it is for a reason. You’ve got to believe it. You’ve got to trust the Almighty’s plan for you. Whatever’s going on in your life, the journey continues. Nothing comes to a standstill. Have faith that it will all work out in the end."
135,2022-05-05 02:50:48+00:00,muftimenk,The most important thing you can do when you’ve done something wrong is to have the courage to own up and admit your fault. Aplogise to the people you’ve wronged. Don’t look for excuses or scapegoats. A sincere apology shows you’re taking responsibility for your own action.
136,2022-05-04 20:55:17+00:00,muftimenk,"At some stage in your life, people  will behave unjustly towards you. Don’t fret &amp; get all upset. The truth will always out eventually. That should give you much comfort. Know that the Almighty is your best witness in all things. Keep your heart at peace no matter what’s going on"
137,2022-05-04 05:21:08+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t curse the crisis you’re facing. Every hardship has a silver lining; a blessing in disguise. Be patient with yourself and let the situation unfold. Do your best and let the Almighty do the rest. You’ll emerge stronger and better able to face whatever He sends your way.

260,2022-03-20 04:26:53+00:00,muftimenk,People have less time for each other as life gets more hectic &amp; stressful. That’s the sad reality. But how often has the Almighty reminded us that He is near. Never think you’re alone. You’re not.  Turn to Him for anything &amp; everything.
261,2022-03-19 20:18:32+00:00,muftimenk,People’s negativity towards you is often not about you. It’s usually their insecurities showing the ugly side. Take it in your stride. Learn to cast aside your anger and pray for them instead.
262,2022-03-19 14:01:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose faith over worry. It’s a choice you have to make.  Do you worry when faced with challenges and life’s trials or do you trust the Almighty, knowing He will always set things right no matter what uncertainties loom head?"
263,2022-03-18 20:32:35+00:00,muftimenk,Many of the conflicts you’re experiencing would end if you stopped telling people so much about what’s going on in your life. Confide in the Almighty instead.
264,2022-03-17 23:00:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep us focused in this journey of life. Starting the race wasn’t a problem; continuing is the challenge. We pray for endurance &amp; resilience in the face of adversity. Grant us the best ending. Keep our hearts firmly attached to You, knowing You always have our backs."
265,2022-03-17 09:38:25+00:00,muftimenk,"We worry because we wonder if we will have what we need, when we need it. But remember that if we expect other people to meet our needs instead of the Almighty, we will end up frustrated and disappointed.  He is the only One who can meet all our needs."
266,2022-03-16 21:52:46+00:00,muftimenk,"When you hit rock bottom and about to throw in the towel, understand that the Almighty wants you to know that everyone may have abandoned you, but the One who made you will always be there for you. Seek Him."
267,2022-03-16 07:58:07+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re going through difficult times, don’t give up. Don’t ever forget all that the Almighty’s done for you, His Promises; the prayers He’s answered. Keep going with a heart full of faith."
268,2022-03-15 20:24:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When people show you who they are, believe them. There’s a reason why the Almighty allowed their mask to fall apart."
269,2022-03-15 08:27:56+00:00,muftimenk,Always value your peace. Your peace is more important than trying to prove a point. Stop explaining yourself to people who have made up their minds on misunderstanding you.
270,2022-03-15 00:24:10+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t stress over what’s happening because the Almighty has promised that what’s coming will be better. Bear beautiful patience.
271,2022-03-14 04:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Death can come anytime. It doesn’t matter if you’re healthy or wealthy, young or old. You’ll have to go when it’s time. And that’s decided by the Almighty. You can’t challenge or avoid it."
272,2022-03-13 17:11:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When you choose to get closer to the Almighty, you might become the target of brickbats and gossip. Never apologize for being a version of you that they’re not used to. If people cannot accept the NEW you,  it’s not your problem but theirs."
273,2022-03-13 02:42:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty blocks it, leave it be.  If you’ve done your part and nothing is happening, move on.  Period."
274,2022-03-12 16:49:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste your time trying to please people.  It’s never achievable.  Remember, we always seem bad to those who hate us. Focus on pleasing the Almighty."
275,2022-03-12 05:22:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Pray for those who criticise you unfairly, judge you wrongly and say hurtful things. Why should you do that? Because you’re not like them so don’t do the same to them. Respond with kindness instead."

277,2022-03-10 22:28:00+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. May all of life’s challenges that You send our way not overwhelm us. May we not be distracted and discouraged by the turn of events and may we always remain steadfast in the face of calamity. We know we’re never alone. You are our Guide. Now and forever. Aameen.
278,2022-03-10 08:27:09+00:00,muftimenk,Think good thoughts. Keep doing good. But this may be difficult for many today who have a holier-than-thou attitude &amp; are constantly judging others. Don’t forget that the person you looked down on may be the one who gets to Paradise before you because of a sincere heart.
279,2022-03-09 22:46:15+00:00,muftimenk,Do you have trust issues? Do you think the Almighty won’t answer your prayers? He has brought you this far. Do you think He will abandon you? He has written your whole life story. Move on with firm faith and trust the next chapter because you know the Author.

282,2022-03-08 12:24:35+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re having doubts about someone’s character, observe them over a period. Time will expose the true person. Remember, you can’t fake it forever. Sooner or later the real identity will emerge."
283,2022-03-08 07:03:28+00:00,muftimenk,"The good you did for them, the pain you relieved them from, the smile you put on their faces even when you were facing your own trials. The Almighty never forgets. So keep doing good because goodness will come your way sooner than you ever imagined."

286,2022-03-06 08:14:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything good is worth striving for. If it were handed to you on a silver platter, it would be too easy; it would lose its worth. This is what Paradise is about. Reflect."
287,2022-03-05 14:14:01+00:00,muftimenk,We all sin. Don’t despair. Keep repenting and asking for His forgiveness. Don't let droplets of  sins become oceans of regret. Be sincere and ask Him wholeheartedly.

290,2022-03-04 08:05:55+00:00,muftimenk,There’s beauty in privacy. Read that again. Resist the temptation to publicize your life on social media. Everything isn’t meant to be on display. Keep things away from the public eye which can easily turn into the evil eye. People can't destroy what they don't know.
291,2022-03-03 23:01:13+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us to remain focused despite the hardship we’re facing. Guide us so we won’t get lost during difficult times.

293,2022-03-02 15:32:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Exercise restraint and don’t judge others, not even silently. We don't know their battles. Look instead at hearts and not faces. See how life becomes clearer that way."
294,2022-03-02 00:29:53+00:00,muftimenk,Think before you respond. Beware knee-jerk reactions where you react to something without thinking of the possible outcome. It often leads to regret. Don’t fall into this trap.
295,2022-03-01 06:21:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Some ask how can patience be beautiful? It's tiring, painful, saps your energy, you wait and wait and it drains you. But it's beautiful simply because you trust the Almighty fully. You may not understand His Plan but you know it will lead to a good end."
296,2022-02-28 15:40:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feel discouraged. It's natural for us to stumble, lose hope and get impatient during trials. It can happen to anyone. But if we remember that the Almighty is in full control, we will slowly but surely see the hidden blessings behind the trials."
297,2022-02-27 12:21:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When you see someone doing wrong, it doesn't necessarily make him a bad person. Everyone struggles with challenges sent their way. Don't judge. Encourage."
298,2022-02-27 05:25:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever you feel sorry for yourself, know that there are people in worse conditions. Be grateful for what you have. Remember, the Almighty can take it all away. Everything is under His control."
299,2022-02-26 10:58:26+00:00,muftimenk,"When we say someone has changed, we really mean their mask has fallen off. We see the real person behind it; the true colors revealed."
300,2022-02-25 22:36:10+00:00,muftimenk,Beauty is not what you think it is. It certainly isn't what people see when they look at you. It's when they find out what lies beneath. Work hard at being beautiful on the inside.
301,2022-02-25 06:55:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us strength to purify our hearts from spiritual diseases like greed, malice, envy, arrogance, hatred etc. Help us to repent sincerely each time we sin. Draw us closer to You and keep our hearts light and pristine. Aameen."
302,2022-02-24 23:24:54+00:00,muftimenk,"When a trial hits you, the Almighty is testing your belief in His Wisdom. Be patient. Life is indeed a series of tests. Remember that no matter how bitter the beginning and the journey, the ending will be sweet."
303,2022-02-24 11:19:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When the heart is filled with arrogance, you become blind. You think you're always right. Everyone else is wrong. Purify that heart."
304,2022-02-23 21:56:40+00:00,muftimenk,Don't think the Almighty doesn't know you're struggling to remain on the straight path. He sees your effort. He rewards your effort. He is with you every step of the way.
305,2022-02-23 11:05:45+00:00,muftimenk,Never look back unless you're planning a trip going that way again. Learn from the past and  aim to make the present and future better. Let go and live.
306,2022-02-22 04:09:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Give up petty arguments and pointless disputes. They're a waste of time and frowned upon by the Almighty. It's better to remain silent and preserve your peace. Honestly, none of this will matter when you're lying in your grave."
307,2022-02-21 03:58:44+00:00,muftimenk,"You have to get back up, no matter what knocks you down each time. Giving up is not an option. Endure, press on and never look back. Great blessings come with great perseverance."
308,2022-02-20 13:37:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Never give up on the Almighty. Bear good patience during your trials. He will answer your prayers, grant you breakthroughs, reward your persistence. Remember, the tears will cease, the wait will be over soon. Keep your faith firm as you wait."
309,2022-02-20 04:20:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Respect other people’s time. We often have a very selfish attitude towards time in that we expect everyone to adjust their schedules around us but we won’t let anyone mess our day. Stop being self-centered and inflexible. Remember, what you give out, you will get back."
310,2022-02-19 12:33:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Let go of your past. Don’t let it get to you. You’ve repented and moved on. The Almighty has forgiven you. Be kind to yourself. Focus on what’s happening right now.  Do good deeds, get closer to Him and work hard to strengthen your faith."
311,2022-02-18 15:15:56+00:00,muftimenk,Keep praying. Pray for those who love you. Pray for those who hate you. Pray for those who try to harm you. Why? Because prayer is the most precious gift you can give someone and a good prayer may soften their heart and lead them to be guided. Imagine the rewards that await you.
312,2022-02-18 03:58:28+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We sincerely ask You to make us better people today than we were yesterday. Help us win the fight between desire and discipline so we may get closer to You. Help us let go of negative people so we may become more positive and grateful with good character and conduct.
313,2022-02-17 17:29:52+00:00,muftimenk,"You think you’re experiencing one of your worst days. Remember, your worst days could be the beginning of your transition to better days. Life has a way of preparing us for exactly what we need. Keep hope alive."
314,2022-02-17 03:48:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of the people you hurt. Remember, they can pray and the Almighty acts on their behalf..... swiftly at times. That thought alone should deter you from hurting people. Be kind always."
315,2022-02-16 16:58:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be mean. Don’t stereotype people and label someone as huge, fat, oversized, obese, thin, scrawny etc. The Almighty made us all special in our own way. Each one has his own unique qualities. So stop having set ideas about people and look at them as individuals."
316,2022-02-16 05:03:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be discouraged by what you see. It may be a huge obstacle in front of you but don’t forget that the greater the trial, the bigger the reward. The Almighty won’t test you beyond your capabilities. Stay firm and your faith will emerge stronger than before."
317,2022-02-15 20:54:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Even in your darkest moments, remember, nights don’t last forever. Morning will come. Keep believing. Keep trusting. The Almighty is your Eternal Refuge, not just in troubled times but for all time."
318,2022-02-15 13:26:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Some take care of their bodies so faithfully but neglect their souls, forgetting that they could die today or tomorrow. Don’t fall into this trap."
319,2022-02-14 19:46:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Disappointment is not a bad thing. When something we dislike happens, we think it’s a mistake. We get upset. We forget that the Almighty is in control. He sees things we don’t. The bigger picture will emerge soon and we will thank Him for His Infinite Wisdom."
320,2022-02-14 05:18:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever it is you’re stressing about, hand it over to the Almighty. And don’t try to control the timing because you will end up frustrated. He has His own schedule. Your job is to trust  him."
321,2022-02-13 16:29:07+00:00,muftimenk,"The pain you’ve experienced &amp; endured should make you a kinder, softer person and a more compassionate one. You shouldn’t become hard and bitter as a result."
322,2022-02-13 04:22:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Most of us get defensive when we're criticized. Don't. Listen instead. Take in the message and see if it’s constructive. Assess the situation and what you need to do. If the comments are valid, work on them. If not, just move on."
323,2022-02-12 17:46:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people think that they need to turn their lives around before they can start praying and getting closer to the Almighty. This is a trick of Satan. Don’t fall for it. No matter what’s going on in your life, pray! He’s waiting for you."
324,2022-02-12 10:21:18+00:00,muftimenk,"True friends are those who are willing to show up during all of your seasons - the good and bad, happy and sad, celebration and grief. The problem today is we have too many fair-weather friends."
325,2022-02-12 04:23:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste time in group chats and online chatter. Many spend hours each day on such frivolous activity and some even do it at the expense of the link with their Creator. Instead, get busy building a connection with the Almighty. Serve humanity. Life's way too short to waste."
326,2022-02-11 15:00:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Often in life we get upset with what happens, especially when things don’t go according to our plan. We forget who is in control. The Lord of the Worlds has the best plans for us always, yet we often doubt, get upset and start questioning Him! Remember, He is the Best Planner."
327,2022-02-11 05:28:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You for inner peace and contentment with whatever You have decreed for us. Let us go through it, bearing full patience, knowing You’re in control. Guide us to the best of manners, repel what’s bad from us, forgive all our sins and purify our hearts. Aameen."
328,2022-02-10 22:37:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Do your best when faced with a challenge. Bear patience and give your utmost. When you think you’ve exhausted your resources and capabilities, that's when the help of the Almighty is closest. Wait for ease to unfold."
329,2022-02-10 14:14:07+00:00,muftimenk,Such is life. The only way some will talk about you is when they hear of bad news about you. They overlook the good you’ve done and become trigger-happy spreading whatever they hear without verifying anything. Let them do what they will. The Almighty knows.
330,2022-02-10 07:08:14+00:00,muftimenk,A heart does not turn cold unless it has been treated badly for a long while. So cherish all those with good hearts in your life. Don’t delay. Show them the gratitude they deserve.
331,2022-02-09 04:34:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the online world. When you let yourself go, you run into the danger of slipping too far into it and losing a sense of real life, real self and real priorities. It can distract people so much from reality that they may forget who they really are. It’s happening now."
332,2022-02-08 16:37:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Be a beacon of hope and positivity in a world, that’s full of negativity and harsh criticism. How difficult is it to say a good word, to encourage and motivate others? And if you can’t, at least don’t hurt people with your words or actions. It’s best to remain quiet."
333,2022-02-08 04:12:48+00:00,muftimenk,"You often hear people ask what if things don’t work out? What they mean is, if things don’t happen the way they planned it. They forget that the Almighty is the best planner. He will make things happen in the best possible way for us. Better than what we wanted. Trust Him."
334,2022-02-07 21:32:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Never beg anyone for anything. Instead, always ask the Almighty. If He wills, He will grant it to you. Remember, nothing is impossible for the Lord of the Worlds."
335,2022-02-07 03:39:16+00:00,muftimenk,Kindness is contagious. Give your kindness away without expecting anything in return. The person you’re being kind to benefits through your help &amp; you'll feel good for having helped someone. The world is made better through your kindness. We need this badly today.
336,2022-02-06 15:32:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty tests you, instead of placing your hopes in other humans who are equally weak, place your trust in the Lord of the Worlds. Place your utmost hopes in Him and watch how He will help you through unimaginable circumstances."
337,2022-02-06 04:14:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Charity begins at home. It’s no point being nice to outsiders when your family becomes your enemy at home. You curse, swear, nitpick over the smallest thing and never have a good word for them. You play mind games. Be careful. The Almighty is aware of all that you do."
338,2022-02-05 10:14:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful what you share on social media.  Even among our family members, there may be people who hide ill feelings towards our achievements &amp; lifestyles behind their smiles. The sad part is that most of the time, people envy what we know isn’t completely real."
339,2022-02-04 21:40:01+00:00,muftimenk,Make kindness your priority. Kind people use positivity to create more light. That’s because they’ve seen what negativity can do. They make time for others in a world that doesn’t wait for anyone. It takes strength to shake off all the bad and move forward.
340,2022-02-04 00:05:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep our hearts soft and protect them from hardening. Shower us with Your Mercy. When we commit a sin, allow us to feel the guilt that comes with it. Don’t make us among those who sin and yet aren’t remorseful. Aameen."
341,2022-02-03 08:24:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Protect yourself as best you can because the evil eye is real. Take precautions. For many, this will be hard because we live in such a self-serving society. We want to show off. There’s a need within many of us to be validated &amp; accepted by others; even those we don’t know."
342,2022-02-02 12:48:27+00:00,muftimenk,The fact is some people will hate you for reasons known only to them. They won’t hesitate to spread rumours and gossip about you. This is a test from the Almighty. Don’t retaliate. Let the good you do speak for itself.
343,2022-02-01 21:38:43+00:00,muftimenk,Nothing can disturb your peace when you have attained that special connection with the Almighty. You fully submit to His Decree. He will provide for you in ways you never imagined. He will protect you from all harm. He will bless you with a kind heart and endear you to others.
344,2022-02-01 08:57:28+00:00,muftimenk,"What the Almighty has done for others, He can do for you. Don’t get upset and envious when He does something for them. You need to understand His Plan. Celebrate the victory of others, be happy for them and He will grant you even more  just because you were patient."
345,2022-01-31 07:39:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit negative thinking. There’s enough of that in the world today. Spread positive vibes. Be the voice of reason. Listen, empower, encourage, motivate and build people up."
346,2022-01-30 03:58:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Pain is something you experience often enough. How it affects you is up to you. Some get really upset, bitter with life. Some take it in their stride; try their best to cope. Some smile &amp; breeze through it. Let your pain have a good purpose. Let it make you better &amp; stronger."
347,2022-01-29 19:48:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Trust the Almighty’s timing. Only He knows why you're in the state you are for so long. Don’t fret because perhaps the delay in answering your prayer is better for you than  getting what you want, when you want it. Trust Him to get you out of the situation at the right time."
348,2022-01-29 00:14:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, if you hear something false about someone, defend him, speak up for him. The Almighty will defend you in this world and the next."
349,2022-01-28 07:39:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You to remove our attachment to worldly things. Instead, make our hearts attached to You and make us love You more. Keep our hearts pure and always obedient in Your Path, no matter what’s going on in our lives. It’s the only way to have peace in our hearts."
350,2022-01-27 21:58:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Trust the Almighty in your journey back to Him. The past may not have turned out the way you planned but remember, He is the best Planner and He can make your future better than you ever imagined."
351,2022-01-27 15:05:02+00:00,muftimenk,Treat people with respect and honour. Never mind how they choose to treat you. Don’t stoop to their level. Treat them with love and kindness. Why should you? For a simple reason that what you do will find its way back to you. The Almighty will make sure it does.
352,2022-01-26 21:50:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Let go of things which don’t concern you. You’ll see your life take on a different turn. You’ll glow from within, be less stressed and have more time for the things that matter."
353,2022-01-26 04:37:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you doubt that the Almighty can solve your problem? The Lord of the Worlds can turn night into day, what makes you think He can’t turn your burdens into blessings?"
354,2022-01-25 08:39:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. The more you’ve gone through hardship and trials, the stronger you become."
355,2022-01-24 08:23:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have friends who will speak good about you behind your back? Friends who will stand up for you and defend you in your absence? If you have such friends, you’re blessed. Nurture the friendship."
356,2022-01-23 11:50:29+00:00,muftimenk,Rumours are dangerous and of course sinful. They can make you hate the righteous and love the hypocrites. Be careful. Stay away from the trap of Satan.
357,2022-01-23 04:10:58+00:00,muftimenk,Everything in life has a purpose. The Almighty does everything for a good reason. Learn from whatever comes your way. Nothing is a mistake or coincidence.
358,2022-01-22 13:07:10+00:00,muftimenk,There’s so much suffering going on around us. It’s a fact that we are better off than so many people in the world. Yet we complain. Our struggles are small compared to others. Count our blessings before the Almighty takes everything away.
359,2022-01-21 21:48:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you feel like you’re constantly waiting? You wait for things to happen. In the process, you can either grow frustrated or you can grow in patience and strength. May the Almighty grant us the ability to wait patiently for what He has in store for us."
360,2022-01-21 07:10:34+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty! We ask You to strengthen us so we can face whatever challenges You put in our path. We know You see our tears and hear our prayers. We also know that You're testing us. Grant us the ability to endure and face the challenges with utmost patience. Aameen.
361,2022-01-20 18:55:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay focused. Don’t quit at the first sign of failure. Good things come to those who persevere and put their trust in the Almighty. You may think that’s the hardest part but if you press on, you’ll succeed."
362,2022-01-19 23:42:13+00:00,muftimenk,We worry about things and look to other people for answers. There’s a better way to do this. Strengthen your link with the Almighty. He will prepare you for what’s to come and guide you along.
363,2022-01-19 06:08:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you a pessimist? It's always easy to make things more problematic and negative than they really are. The next time you catch yourself making a mountain out of a molehill, ask yourself how much of it will matter in five years. Or, even next month. Change your mindset."
364,2022-01-18 23:23:19+00:00,muftimenk,We’ve all experienced pain and fear without exception. How we approach it will determine how we live our lives. Do you allow it to paralyze you such that moving forward becomes a chore? Don’t let your pain and fear define you. Use them to spur you to greater heights.
365,2022-01-18 16:48:31+00:00,muftimenk,"@ReaazAhmed May Allah Almighty forgive his shortcomings, grant him Paradise and make it easy for his loved ones. Aameen"

Once you open your heart to your Creator, you’ll see Him in every part of your life. So read the signs and you’ll find contentment."
367,2022-01-17 22:24:56+00:00,muftimenk,Are you on the verge of giving up? Do you sometimes feel like things have become too difficult and there’s nothing good left for your future. That’s what Satan wants you to believe. Don’t fall for it. The Almighty says never lose hope in His Mercy.
368,2022-01-17 14:45:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be afraid of change. At times, you need to overhaul your life to see your steps ahead. So whatever you’re experiencing, don’t be afraid to start over. This time, you’re not starting from scratch but you’re starting from experience."
369,2022-01-16 21:52:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep asking the Almighty to soften our hearts. May we have compassion for those who suffer in unimaginable ways. Learn to pray passionately for them as we do for ourselves and our loved ones. Above all, may our souls remain humble at all times."
370,2022-01-16 00:11:42+00:00,muftimenk,Take criticism with a pinch of salt. Those doing more than you are unlikely to be the ones criticising you. You will almost always be criticised by people who are doing less.
371,2022-01-15 16:42:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Grieve by all means but don’t let it consume you to such an extent that you forget who’s in control. Try to step away from your broken state, even if just for a moment. You’ll realise that you own nothing. Nothing at all. Everything is on loan from the Almighty."
372,2022-01-14 21:21:27+00:00,muftimenk,We think our problems will never get better. That’s our whole problem. We lack faith. We lack trust in the Almighty. Has it occurred to us that He already had the solution way before we had the problem?
373,2022-01-14 00:11:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Hear our humble, heartfelt prayers - for a world that’s fast falling apart, for people who are broken and injured, for hearts that have been shattered, for those who no longer have a home &amp; who've lost loved ones. We pray for ease and comfort. Aameen."
374,2022-01-13 15:39:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember to engage your brain before the mouth is in gear. It’s easy to just blurt out what you feel in the heat of the moment. It takes only a few seconds of hurtful words to penetrate deep into a person’s heart and they may take years to heal, if at all."
375,2022-01-13 08:00:23+00:00,muftimenk,"You may be in the depths of despair but remember, storms don’t last forever. They can shake you to the core. But they will pass. The Almighty has promised us, with hardship comes ease. So the rain will stop eventually and you’ll find peace after the chaos."
376,2022-01-12 19:13:29+00:00,muftimenk,"People judge others based on their own actions, thoughts and ideas. Don't think others are sinful according to your standards.

Guidance is a marathon, filled with ups and downs. Some days are better than others. But persevere &amp; seek His help. You’ll get there."

384,2022-01-08 22:40:54+00:00,muftimenk,Note to self: The mind replays what the heart cannot delete. So be careful what you keep in your heart. Purify it often with remembrance of your Creator.
385,2022-01-08 03:17:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, nothing is too small or too big for the Almighty. Just ask Him. He never gets bored listening to your prayer. He loves it when you seek Him."
386,2022-01-07 16:59:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn from the mistakes you make in life. They are turning points. They bear important lessons. Remember, none of it is random. The Almighty designs them for a reason. They are meant to make you a better person. Correct yourself and move on."
387,2022-01-07 07:39:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Accept the deeds that we do solely for Your Sake. We are trying our best. We’re not perfect. We often falter, we sin, we make mistakes. Forgive us. We will never lose hope in Your Mercy and will always keep our hearts attached to You. Aameen."
388,2022-01-06 10:34:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t take things personally - an important aspect of self-care. When we don't take things personally, we recognize individuality and uniqueness in people. We accept that other people are different from us and that’s ok."
389,2022-01-05 13:43:48+00:00,muftimenk,Satan will remind you to focus on the burden &amp; miss the blessing. The Almighty has brought you this far. Do you think He will abandon you?
390,2022-01-05 00:01:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Never underestimate the endless ripple effect of any act of goodness and kindness, no matter how small it is. Sooner or later, it will make its way back to you. Remember, what goes around, comes around. Perhaps not immediately but trust the Almighty to reward you eventually."
391,2022-01-04 08:58:38+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t tear someone down just to get yourself up there. Trust me it won’t last. The Almighty will see to that. Always be fair and just in all that you undertake.
392,2022-01-04 00:40:31+00:00,muftimenk,Say no to people who mess with your head. The ones who keep doing things intentionally to upset you. The ones who always play the victim even though it’s obvious they’re wrong. The ones who expect you to prioritise them but won’t do the same for you. Avoid them.
393,2022-01-03 07:20:13+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t pray only for yourself. Pray for others. Be generous with your prayers. Pray for those who have battles they don’t talk about.
394,2022-01-03 00:32:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t rush people. Give them the time and space they need to to heal from their hurt. We all deal with trials and tribulations in our own unique ways. Lend an ear,  a helping hand, make sure they know you’re there if they need you. That’s the best help you can offer."
395,2022-01-02 09:36:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Repeat this as often as you need to. Reset, reorientate, revamp, restart, readjust, rethink, reposition, etc. Don’t let your history determine your future. Today is a brand new day. Trust the Almighty to lay out the best plans for you."
396,2022-01-01 21:53:25+00:00,muftimenk,Let’s face it. Most of the things we worry about in life are insignificant. Most of them we can’t control anyway. It’s the Almighty’s way of showing us who’s in control. So focus on being the best version of ourselves. Hand over the rest to Him.
397,2022-01-01 04:21:06+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help me to trust Your timing and NOT my own. Aameen.
398,2021-12-31 21:45:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever’s going on around you, don’t let the negativity of the world depress you. Don't let your burdens drown you. Don’t think that your sins are the size of mountains and there’s no hope! Turn to the Almighty with sincere repentance. He loves those who repent."
399,2021-12-31 08:16:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant strength to those suffering in silence, where life is hard and they feel they can't go on. But they put on a brave front despite all that. Have mercy on them. Pick them up and help them get through the difficult period. Aameen."
400,2021-12-31 02:38:56+00:00,muftimenk,Are you on the verge of giving up? Don’t! Think of how far you’ve come. Everything you’ve been through; the times you thought you couldn’t make it but did; the mornings you couldn’t get out of bed but pushed yourself anyway. Always seek your strength from the Almighty.
401,2021-12-30 12:12:22+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re trying hard and the Almighty knows. He will keep testing you to see if you’re sincere; if you’re striving your utmost and bearing patience. Honestly, that’s all that matters. That He is satisfied you tried your best."
402,2021-12-30 05:15:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, nothing lasts. Where you are today isn’t where you will stay. The Almighty has promised. Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise with each new day. Keep hope alive in your heart. He’s right with you."
403,2021-12-29 06:33:33+00:00,muftimenk,"We can't sit back and expect the Almighty to do everything for us. It's a two-way process. Show gratitude, get closer to Him. He'll guide us."
404,2021-12-28 22:23:29+00:00,muftimenk,Do you feel the need to answer to your critics? You don’t have to. You don’t have to try and prove to people who you are. Your journey is yours alone. Remain steadfast. Honour the Almighty. He will work things out for you in the end. Just remain calm and bear patience.
405,2021-12-28 05:56:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Good days and bad days. You will learn more from the bad days than the good ones because they’re designed to toughen you. But first, you must learn the life lessons attached to them. Some don’t and they get stuck at a certain level. Pray for guidance."
406,2021-12-27 16:02:04+00:00,muftimenk,Many factors can affect the peace in your heart. It’s not easy but you must find a way to do it. Plug in with the Almighty. Let Him take over when you feel you’ve done your best. You’ll see every sunrise holds more promise; every sunset holds more peace.
407,2021-12-27 04:26:55+00:00,muftimenk,Do yourself a favour. Protect your mind from overthinking. It’s a disability which serves no purpose. You need to protect your own thoughts. There’s nothing in this world that can trouble you more than your own thoughts.
408,2021-12-26 18:58:56+00:00,muftimenk,"We all get knocked down, some harder than others. That's a fact of life. Deal with it. Get up again. It'll help you grow. You're stronger than you think. You can do it. Quitting is never an option."
409,2021-12-26 04:09:25+00:00,muftimenk,Struggling in life is part of your journey. Nothing comes easy. Getting close to the Almighty is a lifelong process. You cannot expect everything to magically fall into place. You need to depend on Him and trust that what He has planned for you is the best.
410,2021-12-25 22:09:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Has it occurred to you that each time you pray, it could be your last? So take your time and develop a no-rush policy when praying to your Creator. May the Almighty be pleased with us and have Mercy on us all, the day He decides to take us."
411,2021-12-25 05:08:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever your situation may be, the Almighty has all the answers; even if they aren’t the answers you want at that time. You have to trust Him when you face a closed door. After all, has He not brought you this far?  Do you think He will abandon you tomorrow?"
412,2021-12-24 20:30:58+00:00,muftimenk,Relationships are suffering because we just can’t put our phones down. Parents &amp; children spend hours on mobile devices hence cutting down the time for face to face interaction. Make an effort to reduce the use of your devices &amp; start building healthy family bonds.
413,2021-12-24 11:24:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the ones who are distressed when good things come your way. But if harm strikes you, they will be among the first to rejoice. You have to be patient with them. Their plot will not harm you. The Almighty is the Best Planner."
414,2021-12-24 03:24:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant hope to those who feel broken and in need of comfort. It may be hard for some to focus on blessings when times are tough. When days look dark &amp; stress runs high, guide them to the path of light. Aameen."
415,2021-12-23 23:46:40+00:00,muftimenk,"No squabble or argument is worth it; don't sacrifice your Hereafter for these pettiness. Avoid it and if you can’t, excuse yourself and walk away. Make peace with those you've offended or insulted."
416,2021-12-23 05:42:41+00:00,muftimenk,"When you ask the Almighty, always do it wholeheartedly; always be certain that He will answer. Know that He will respond sooner or later. In fact, He knows what’s in your heart even before you asked Him. Don’t supplicate with an attitude of doubt and uncertainty. Trust Him."
417,2021-12-22 19:29:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Without humility, you won’t go far in life, no matter how successful you think you are. There are many out there who strut around acting like they own the world. Stay away from such behaviour. Be humble. Be compassionate. Nothing belongs to us honestly. Reflect."
418,2021-12-21 22:08:45+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to ignore the behavior of toxic and irritating people. The truth is they are hurting; that’s why they choose to hurt others. They are full of fear and insecurity. Ignore the hate they spew. Respond with patience and love. Say a prayer for them.
419,2021-12-21 09:36:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing is guaranteed in life. Don’t take things for granted. Here today, gone tomorrow is real and many of us have seen it happen to our loved ones and close friends. We never know when our time will be up. So forgive, spread goodness and pray for a good end to our journey."
420,2021-12-20 20:57:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Highs and lows are part of life. Don’t expect a smooth road. But the Almighty will never let you down if you bear beautiful patience and trust Him.

421,2021-12-20 03:20:55+00:00,muftimenk,"May the Almighty protect the people of #Malaysia and the #Philippines from the floods and extreme weather they’re facing. The young, the sick and the elderly are the most vulnerable as they’re being evacuated to safer areas. May He grant ease and restore normalcy soon. Aameen."
422,2021-12-20 01:13:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Give to charity what you would still want and use for yourself. Don’t just give discards, leftovers, etc. If you’re able to part with things you still want, you’ve shown the mark of a truly generous heart."
423,2021-12-19 13:06:35+00:00,muftimenk,Everything is going to work out in the end. Read that again. You have to trust the Almighty. Tell your heart not to be anxious. Do your best and hand it over to Him. Don’t overthink and don’t listen to whisperings in your head.
424,2021-12-19 05:38:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Refrain from blaming, pointing a finger or condemning someone. We all sin, we all have our weak points. At the end of the day, we're all answerable to the Almighty."
425,2021-12-18 21:31:37+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t judge people based on what you heard about them. Preconceived ideas are not useful. Give everyone a chance. Hear them out. Wouldn’t you like to be given that chance if you were in their shoes? Be fair.
426,2021-12-17 20:34:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us the ability to help each other more readily, the patience &amp; understanding to deal with people, to always utter good words &amp; encourage others. Guide us towards Your Path, the path of true success. Grant us the best of this world &amp; the Hereafter. Aameen."
427,2021-12-16 22:25:10+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want to repent but you find yourself struggling with conflicting emotions, don't despair. Remember, Satan will do what it takes to steer you away from the Almighty. Understand his tricks. No matter how far down the wrong road you are, turn back to Him without delay."
428,2021-12-16 04:09:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is short. If you fill your heart with the love of the Almighty, He will reward you manifold and open doors you never imagined. But if you draw away from Him and fill your time with mindless distractions, you’ll end up lost in a stormy sea. Seek Him before it’s too late."
429,2021-12-15 21:58:35+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want peace in your life, learn to keep your distance from anything and anyone who disrupts it. Remember, you don’t have to react to everything.

430,2021-12-15 07:52:45+00:00,muftimenk,Privacy is key; that is if you value your peace and mental health. Oversharing is the root of many problems. Keep it low-key. Keep it unpredictable. No drama. It’s a huge barrier against those who want to destroy your plans.
431,2021-12-14 21:00:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Avoid the company of he who complains often, is quick to find fault and appreciates little. There’s always something amiss. Keep friends who are grateful and give positive vibes."

433,2021-12-13 00:08:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Your words can wound and scar. Learn to listen to yourself when you speak. Don’t speak incessantly and too loudly, without regard for those around you. Always ask the Almighty to guide you to say the right things at the right time in the right tone so you won’t be misunderstood."
434,2021-12-12 10:43:53+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll be challenged. You’ll be tested. At times it may  feel like you’re being pushed to the edge. This is what life’s about. It’s meant to build character, strengthen your belief and build confidence. Embrace your tests."
435,2021-12-11 04:30:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, everything happens for a reason. Sometimes you may not be able to comprehend it. That’s okay because the Lord of the Worlds is in control. So let it go and trust Him. Your peace is more important than trying to figure everything out."
436,2021-12-10 16:17:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be affected by criticism. Positive or negative, take them in your stride. Know that the level of criticism rises with your worth."

438,2021-12-09 22:08:48+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, you’ll meet all sorts of people. Among them, those you can't have a reasonable conversation with; they somehow twist your words or totally confuse you and then tell you that you're the one who doesn't know how to communicate.

530,2021-10-24 13:04:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fall for Satan’s plot. He does not want you to repent at all. But if he fails in his attempt, the next best plan is to delay your repentance. He tries to tell you that it will be easier later on. That’s a lie. The longer you wait, the harder it gets to repent. Don’t delay."
531,2021-10-24 05:43:52+00:00,muftimenk,We tend to think the grass is always greener on the other side. Sadly we usually feel what we have is not good enough. We love comparing; we think we deserve a better life. We become restless. Be careful. The Almighty can remove everything in the blink of an eye. Be grateful.
532,2021-10-23 20:41:19+00:00,muftimenk,"We are in a sad state today. We let society dictate the norms, we become victims of our own desires. We find it easy to please the world. We want to appear great in front of others. What about our Creator? How much are we willing to do to please Him? Let’s get our act together."
533,2021-10-23 06:36:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Knowing what not to say is equally important. We often focus on what we say &amp; forget this part. Don’t feel like you have to respond to everyone &amp; take part in every discussion &amp; argument thrown at you. Often, the best response in many situations is simply to remain silent. Peace."
534,2021-10-22 14:06:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let them make you believe that loving yourself is selfish. It’s not. It’s necessary. When you love yourself, you have more to offer others. Above all, be yourself. The Almighty has made you in the best possible way and if they don’t like it, they can move on."
535,2021-10-22 03:12:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You to purify our hearts. Help us see the positive side of things. There’s so much negativity in the world today. We know You want the best for us. Help us press the reset button of repentance, realizing our need for You always. Keep guiding us. Aameen."
536,2021-10-21 22:05:45+00:00,muftimenk,"You seldom get second chances with humans. Once you’ve messed up, you’re labelled a failure. With the Almighty, it’s completely different. You’ll be given a second, third, fourth chance etc. He’ll always throw you a lifeline. Call on Him &amp; He will lift you out of your misery."
537,2021-10-21 07:58:06+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have friends who will show up when you’re down, you’re blessed. There are too many fair-weather friends in this world. Remember, not everyone has the capacity and will to be present when you’re not shining. It takes a special heart to do that."
538,2021-10-20 20:13:52+00:00,muftimenk,Things didn’t work out because you were under the Almighty’s Divine Protection. Understand His Plan. Yet half the time we pine for what’s over and gone and refuse to accept that He did it in our best interest. He always does.
539,2021-10-20 08:25:08+00:00,muftimenk,Let people assume whatever they want about you. You’re not responsible for their assumptions and whatever else they think they know about you and who you’re supposed to be. You can’t stop them anyway. It has nothing to do with who you really are. Just live.
540,2021-10-19 22:54:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When you pray, pray with confidence. Don’t let circumstances intimidate you. Don’t give up. You’re asking the Lord of the Worlds. Nothing is impossible for Him. Your prayers will be answered according to His timing. Keep praying."
541,2021-10-19 08:08:04+00:00,muftimenk,"When you put your full trust in the Almighty and refuse to give up, you’ll achieve what you set out to do. Persistent faith will lead you to success in this world and the next. It doesn’t mean everything is perfect but you press on because you know that He wants the best for you."
542,2021-10-18 20:38:17+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty has planned it all for your good. He has a master plan for your life. There may be things you don’t understand right now but do not worry. All the pieces are not in place yet. One day it will all come together and everything will make sense. Keep trusting Him.
543,2021-10-18 13:11:41+00:00,muftimenk,Attention and recognition are what some crave. They love being controversial. They love making headlines and being in the limelight. Be careful. Think of the consequences when you’re alone in your grave or worse having to defend yourself before your Creator on Judgement Day.
544,2021-10-18 05:36:43+00:00,muftimenk,Do you find yourself being tested again and again even though you’re doing all that the Almighty has asked of you? Don’t fret. Know that your trials are a blessing not a punishment. He loves you and sends the toughest tests to his best soldiers. Endure with beautiful patience.
545,2021-10-17 18:28:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Be proactive in your journey called life. No matter how long you’ve been walking down the road, once you see a dead end, a roadblock, a no entry sign, give yourself permission to turn around. You’re never stuck if you stay connected to the Almighty. He will always find a way out!"
546,2021-10-17 09:46:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have someone who always finds fault or advises you about your life, job, habits, etc? But the person never follows his own advice. Some have an agenda and can hurt your self-confidence badly. Don’t give your time to deceitful people pretending to be what they’re not."
547,2021-10-16 18:24:31+00:00,muftimenk,You were waiting for that apology but it never came. And that is okay. Don’t focus on it. Let it go. Don’t let it consume you. Let the Almighty take care of things. Healing begins when you can accept that and move on with peace in your heart.
548,2021-10-16 10:57:43+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s wrong to assume that the ones who are quiet are empty, blank with nothing to offer. They might be busy reflecting, observing etc. They’d rather watch the drama from the sidelines. Silence has its merits so when it’s time to speak up, they will. Give people some credit."
549,2021-10-16 03:28:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't allow your circumstances to dictate your feelings. When you accept the Almighty’s Decree fully, you have the right attitude towards difficulties and trials. You accept there’s good in everything eventually. You’re able to walk firmly &amp; steadily. You have firm faith in Him."
550,2021-10-15 16:46:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of the one who pretends to be your best friend, only to turn around and betray you, spreading lies, untruths and hurtful gossip about you. Whatever the reason behind this behavior, it's important to protect yourself from it. Stay away from such people. Pray for them!"
551,2021-10-15 03:31:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. There’s so much going on in the world around us. We beg You to help everyone who’s going through pain &amp; hardship in life. Many feel broken. May You grant ease, remove all obstacles &amp; guide us all out of difficulty. Make us completely dependent on You and You alone."
552,2021-10-14 22:05:17+00:00,muftimenk,Don't you dare give up because you’re tired of waiting. How could you? Have you forgotten the Almighty’s promise? He won’t burden you with that which you have no ability to bear. Trust Him. He’s in full control &amp; watching over you. Keep going; your breakthrough is in sight.
553,2021-10-14 12:53:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you often wonder, “why does this keep happening to me?” Perhaps it’s time for self-reflection. Perhaps the same behavioural patterns are giving you the same, unwanted results. Perhaps, the Almighty wants you to learn the lesson before He elevates you to the next level."
554,2021-10-14 03:45:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Leave people better than when you found them. Smile, lend a helping hand, use good words; do what it takes. Go out of your way if possible. They will remember you long after you left them. Such is the ripple effect of doing good. Never belittle any such act, no matter how small."
555,2021-10-13 17:51:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty can see the road more clearly than we can. He is in complete control of every aspect of our existence. So when He shows us the signs to move on, do it. Trust Him. Keep praying for guidance. He is our best Guardian and Protector."
556,2021-10-13 11:06:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Cultivate the habit of letting the Almighty deal with things beyond your control. Do your best and pray. When you pray, trust that He will work all things out for your own good. Then rest assured knowing that He wants only the best for you always."
557,2021-10-13 05:49:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Things won't always work out the way you planned so whenever they do, be grateful. Whenever they don’t, be even more grateful because the Almighty is saving you from things you do not know. Never take anything for granted. His Divine Wisdom is beyond our understanding. Trust Him."
558,2021-10-12 22:42:07+00:00,muftimenk,"There are some people who will purposely doubt your every move no matter how well intended. Leave them be. Stop over-explaining. If they’re bent on misunderstanding you, they will do so no matter what you say. Don’t fret. The Almighty knows your heart. That’s all that matters."
559,2021-10-12 14:30:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop doing things that bring negative energy into your life. Don’t listen to gossip, empty chatter etc. Connect with people who can motivate you &amp; bring on positivity. No matter how difficult it is, you must make a concerted effort to move on in your life in the best possible way"
560,2021-10-12 04:24:05+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, you have to know when to shut out the noise. There will always be those who will falsely accuse you. Let the naysayers be. As long as you’ve done no wrong, be at peace. The Almighty knows. He will calm you and grant you contentment no matter what they say about you."
561,2021-10-11 21:37:24+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re going through hard times now, remember it won’t last. You will become a better version of yourself because of what you endured. Hard times make you resilient. It may not feel so now but it will be worth it in the end. Just press on. Stopping is not an option."
562,2021-10-11 20:50:49+00:00,muftimenk,@QariZiyaadPatel True. I'm sure there are many others who serve in a similar way. Hidden gems. May Allah bless them all. Aameen
563,2021-10-11 12:56:40+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re not trying to impress anyone but the Almighty, your whole life will take on a different perspective. Much of what you’ve been through will add a breath of fresh air to your life. Your habits, decisions, responses etc will change. You’re not worried what people think."
564,2021-10-11 00:21:11+00:00,muftimenk,Growth is quiet. It doesn’t shout. It’s humble and reassuring. You feel a deep sense of achievement  but you don’t seek validation. You feel a sense of calm. You know you gave it all you got; and you know that the Almighty knows. That’s good enough for you.
565,2021-10-10 18:06:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't stay long where you don't belong. When people are engaged in gossip, backbiting etc plan your move. Learn when to leave. It's wisdom. Save yourself from the unnecessary chatter which is not only an absolute waste of time &amp; sinful but will also eat away at your good deeds."
566,2021-10-10 04:57:47+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty doesn’t promise us an easy ride; a life with no scars. When we experience life’s challenges, we will be changed. The more trust we have in Him, the stronger our faith, the better life becomes. The decision is ours to make. Let’s not short-change ourselves."
567,2021-10-09 20:03:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop revisiting your past. It no longer exists. It doesn’t define you. It’s a good reminder but don’t allow it to hinder your future. As long as it woke you up from your slumber and you’re trying to fix things for the better, that’s good enough. The Almighty sees your efforts."
568,2021-10-09 13:31:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be afraid to say no. If you can’t do something, say it. If you can’t fit it to your schedule, say no. You can’t do what you’re supposed to do to the best of your ability if you’re overwhelmed. Stop trying to please everyone. Your well-being matters as well."
569,2021-10-09 05:19:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s face it. Many love to vent. They feel like venting to others takes a load off their chest and makes them feel better. Learn how to heal without venting to everyone. Turn to the Almighty for all your needs. After all, He’s the only One who knows everything about you."
570,2021-10-08 19:21:54+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us think of death often and the fact that we will all be returning to You. Help us realise that it could happen anytime. Take us only when You are totally pleased with us. In the mean time help us prepare well for that long-awaited meeting with You. Aameen
571,2021-10-08 08:44:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful who you allow on your boat. The wrong people could do untold damage to the whole boat, even causing it to capsize. Steer clear of those who love to gossip &amp; spread lies. Don’t bring them on board. Keep your circle small. Choose only the ones you can trust."
572,2021-10-08 03:41:24+00:00,muftimenk,Quit overthinking. It will rob you of your peace and sleep. You’ll end up miserable and frustrated with life. Don’t do this to yourself. Keep praying and asking the Almighty to ease your affairs and leave things to Him. Trust that He will grant you the best outcome.
573,2021-10-07 15:52:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t judge. Be kind. Many are struggling with so many life issues, aggravated by the pandemic. Yet they carry on as if everything is normal in their lives. They may be your friends or even family members. You never know the private, silent battles they’re going through."
574,2021-10-06 21:29:06+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have a strong connection with your Creator, even your “bad days” are blessed days. You take everything in your stride, you’re not fretting because you know that He knows and He always has your back. So you go through life with a heart full of faith, one step at a time."
575,2021-10-06 10:15:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind and good-hearted wherever life takes you. It's not your job to change someone. You can lead by example and show them the best behaviour, but remember, at the end of the day, guidance comes from the Almighty. Your job is to spread love and goodness. Pray for them."
576,2021-10-05 19:23:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty doesn’t close one door without opening another one with bigger and better things eventually. You have to trust Him. Every disappointment is an opportunity for something greater; and remember He not only opens doors, He closes them as well."
577,2021-10-05 01:54:07+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll be at peace when you find the strength to trust the Almighty unequivocally. Remember, He’s perfect in all ways. Trust His directions for your journey. Keep moving ahead, even when the going gets tough. Nothing good comes easy!"

579,2021-10-04 11:20:58+00:00,muftimenk,"When you trust the Almighty, there’s no worry. Worry &amp; worship don’t go together. Worry is a powerful tool used by Satan to deny us of what our Lord has planned for us. He will plant all sorts of ideas in our head. Do not let Satan get the upper hand. Be on guard. Stay vigilant."
580,2021-10-04 05:02:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Even when they treat you badly, keep a good attitude. Even when things are not going your way, keep a positive outlook. Remember, the Almighty is watching all that you do. His tests are meant to strengthen you and allow you to grow. Do your best and He will elevate your status."
581,2021-10-03 22:09:16+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty has planned every single detail for us. It’s special &amp; unique to each one. He may guide you to something that doesn’t make sense to others. Don’t copy what others are doing. Do what works for you &amp; for your life. Don’t ever feel bad or ashamed of your journey.
582,2021-10-02 20:54:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful what you say. Don’t let your words wound people’s hearts. Be selective in your choice. Use words that encourage, empower and motivate. Use your words to invest in all that’s good. We need that now more than ever. Keep negativity far away."
583,2021-10-02 08:11:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t attach yourself to that which is temporary. Do your best in everything but remember that the goal should always be to please the Almighty. Seek His help to purify your intent. As long as the link with Him is good, any hurdle along the way will become a lot easier to handle."
584,2021-10-01 17:25:03+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, your worst enemy could be your own memory. Stop thinking of things that happened in the past. As long as you’ve learnt your lesson, let all the mess go! Don’t dwell on it. That’s what Satan wants. Don’t give in to him. Don’t let him pollute your mind."
585,2021-10-01 06:00:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep our hearts firm &amp; make us steadfast in our prayers &amp; acts of worship done solely for You. Grant us humility and a soft heart, never showing off or feeling that we’re more pious than the next person. Protect us from being arrogant &amp; may we never judge others. Ameen."
586,2021-09-30 16:20:16+00:00,muftimenk,The end of something is often the beginning of something new. Don’t mope over what’s done. We usually get so caught up with things that we can’t see the light of day! Life is a process. Trust the journey because the Lord of the Worlds is the Best Planner. He’s in full control.
587,2021-09-29 16:24:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Always be prepared to lend people a helping hand in their time of need. It’s so much better than a thousand hands clapping for someone’s success. When you help alleviate another person’s problems, the Almighty will surely do the same for you in this world and the Hereafter."
588,2021-09-29 05:49:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Make it a habit to do good, no matter what’s going on in your life. When you sow good seeds, you will reap and enjoy a good harvest later on. So don’t entertain any negativity and friends who try to talk you out of doing good. Keep selfishness at bay."
589,2021-09-28 21:09:09+00:00,muftimenk,"The world is in a sad state. People have become callous &amp; hearts hardened. They’re more argumentative &amp; often on edge. Swear words are the norm &amp; good speech considered boring. Mental health, depression, anxiety have become buzz words. We desperately need compassion &amp; empathy."
590,2021-09-28 09:33:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Never be ashamed of the scars as a result of your journey. It’s testimony that you’ve conquered the pain, learnt your lesson and emerged stronger for it. Don’t allow your scars to hold you hostage. See them in a positive light. See them as a sign of strength to do even better."
591,2021-09-27 15:59:17+00:00,muftimenk,Be wary of those who are keen to see you fail. They will tell you to not bother doing certain things because you aren’t good enough. Ignore them. The Almighty has fully equipped you and empowered you to overcome whatever needs to be done. Don’t let such comments set you back.
592,2021-09-27 06:09:46+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has created  you for a purpose not for popularity. You’re not everyone’s cup of tea and that’s okay. Not everyone will like you and that’s okay too. Strive to please your Creator, not the creation. You’ll never be good enough for people. That’s the nature of life."
593,2021-09-26 20:49:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Let go of the disappointments, let go of what didn’t work out, let go of negativity, let go of yesterday’s baggage, let go of the hurt because of what someone said to you. Get your mind going in the right direction. Seek guidance from the Almighty. Let peace reign in your heart."
594,2021-09-26 05:58:18+00:00,muftimenk,It’s the Almighty’s plan that you’ve made it this far. Many things could’ve halted your progress but you’ve moved past them with grit. Many times you were tempted to give up but you’ve managed to find light where it was dim. You are exactly where you need to be. Trust Him.
595,2021-09-25 21:41:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Never doubt that the Almighty is always with you. Ask Him for guidance to solve your greatest problems, peace to go through your greatest storms, patience to wait on the answers to your heartfelt prayers and firm faith in the midst of your most challenging tests and situations."
596,2021-09-25 09:36:50+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes what didn’t work out for you was indeed the best thing that happened to you. But you couldn’t see it then because you were lamenting the loss. You have to trust the Almighty in your journey. He will always map out the best plan for you. Trust the process.
597,2021-09-24 10:49:29+00:00,muftimenk,"If and when you’re tempted to speak about someone else’s fault, speak of yours first. Often it’s far easier to fix other people’s problems than focusing on your own. Whatever fault you’ve identified in a person, probably goes to show that the fault is also there in yourself."
598,2021-09-24 05:35:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Make sinning difficult for us. When we’re tempted to sin, let us remember that You’re watching &amp; that the Angels are recording all that we do. Give us the strength to exercise self-control &amp; to stay away from things which displease You. Keep our hearts attached to You."
599,2021-09-23 18:43:31+00:00,muftimenk,"What is this life but a journey. You’ll see people come &amp; go. Some will be gems, others will disappoint you. Promises will be made &amp; broken. Dreams turn into nightmares. Whatever happens, take it in your stride, knowing the Almighty planned it &amp; will see you through it."
600,2021-09-23 04:48:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Do good, no matter how small the deed. The Almighty never forgets the good you’ve done. He’s aware what you did for others, the hardship you experienced, the pain you relieved them from. Nothing escapes Him. So even if you don’t receive good in return, don’t fret. He knows."
601,2021-09-22 21:18:07+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t you dare give up on the Almighty. Never quit on what He is leading you to do. Even if it gets hard. Even if it doesn’t make sense. Your job is to stay rooted to your faith and trust Him. He will always find a way for you and the results will be apparent. Be patient.
602,2021-09-22 06:52:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Never think that the Almighty is your last hope! He’s not! He’s your ONLY hope. Unfortunately, we put more trust in the creation rather than the Creator! He’s the only One who can do for us what no man could ever do! So turn to Him and only Him!"
603,2021-09-21 21:40:39+00:00,muftimenk,"The world is one big distraction. Ask the Almighty to keep us away from things which make us lose focus. Have the courage to say no. No more living to please people. Don’t worry about what others think, no more fighting battles that don’t matter. Time to get back on track."
604,2021-09-21 04:57:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through in life, pray. When you think you’re done, pray again. When the world is asleep, pray. Remember, prayer not only changes things, it changes people’s hearts and that in turn can change your circumstances. So pray for it, then prepare for it."
605,2021-09-20 21:41:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Always ask the Almighty to enable our eyes to see the good, the positive and the blessings He has bestowed on us. May He lift our eyes from what is lacking in our lives to the uncountable blessings that surround us. May He humble us and make us among the grateful!"
606,2021-09-20 15:54:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, it’s not always just about you. Often, there are other people involved and your actions do affect them. So be careful what you say and do. Think of the implications and ramifications. Don’t just shoot from the hip! Be considerate."
607,2021-09-19 22:32:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fall for Satan’s tricks. If can’t trap you into sinning, he keeps you busy with trivial acts which have no benefit. Instead of using your time wisely, fulfilling priorities towards the Almighty &amp; reaching your goal, Satan occupies you with useless actions. Stay vigilant."
608,2021-09-19 03:59:56+00:00,muftimenk,"You won’t be able to find answers to everything. Some questions don’t need answers &amp; they’re better off that way. You just need a firm heart, full of trust that it will turn out fine. A heart full of love &amp; peace. You’ll be amazed at how much more you get out of the unspoken."
609,2021-09-18 18:44:38+00:00,muftimenk,Find peace in whatever situation we’re facing right now. Constantly remind ourselves that things will never be perfect but we have a perfect Creator who will grant us peace way beyond our understanding. Trust His Divine Wisdom to restore order and balance to our lives.
610,2021-09-17 22:32:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, charity begins at home. So don’t make your friends more important than your family. Some people are so good to those outside their homes but treat their family members badly; with abusive talk and action. If that’s the case, you’ve lost credibility with the Almighty."
611,2021-09-17 15:26:59+00:00,muftimenk,"The good and bad, happy and sad - these things will happen in your life. Try not to be upset, learn to take things in your stride. It’s all part of the Almighty’s Plan. So accept His Decree &amp; face everything with full confidence, knowing that He’s watching over you."
612,2021-09-17 04:14:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. You are indeed the Best Planner. We thank You for giving us the strength when we felt like giving up. We’ve learnt not to panic  because we know You’re with us. Keep our hearts firm in faith, come what may. We fully trust everything that You have planned for us. Aameen"
613,2021-09-16 16:41:07+00:00,muftimenk,Two wrongs don’t make a right. Hurting back the people who hurt you makes you just like them. Be careful. Learn to rise above it all. Don’t stoop down to their level. It’s not worth it. Besides that’s not who you are. Keep your character intact. Take the high road instead.
614,2021-09-16 04:51:39+00:00,muftimenk,"The choice is yours to focus on your blessings or your problems. Whichever you choose will either bring about contentment or worry &amp; stress in your life. The more you focus on your blessings, the more the Almighty will bestow upon you. He loves a grateful heart. So choose wisely."
615,2021-09-15 22:31:06+00:00,muftimenk,"We have no qualms about spending hours on social media, yet when it comes to time with the Almighty, we’re stingy. We forget that He’s the Owner of time &amp; it’s one of His most dignified favours. If He doesn’t will it, nothing can be done. So use time wisely before it’s too late."
616,2021-09-14 22:28:02+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty cares about you more than you can ever imagine. But you need to surrender to Him. He will work things out for your good. He is the Owner of everything you need. Your peace, your joy, your success, your happiness, it all lies with Him and Him alone. Connect with Him!"
617,2021-09-14 08:20:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Hold tight to your faith. No matter what lies ahead, remember, the Almighty is already there, ahead of you. He already knows what’s going on while you’re still trying to figure it out. He has solutions to all your problems; financial, personal, marital, family, etc. Turn to Him."
618,2021-09-13 22:58:34+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t become unkind as a result of what others may have done to you. Don’t let their actions turn you cold on the inside. Seek comfort and solace in the Almighty. He is the Healer of broken hearts. Learn from the experience but don’t become bitter.
619,2021-09-13 11:51:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Before speaking ill of someone, ask yourself; if present, would the person you’re speaking about become unhappy with what you’re saying? If so, then consider staying quiet. It is better to communicate directly with the person than to speak about him behind his  back."
620,2021-09-12 18:54:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Secure people are not affected when others do better and shine! In fact, they celebrate and support such achievements instead of saying nasty things or being a dampener. Remember, level up in life not by pushing others down but by pulling yourself up."
621,2021-09-11 23:36:44+00:00,muftimenk,"With the Almighty, the impossible is possible. So keep supplicating because He will make sure that when the doors open, you’re certainly prepared to go through it. He knows when you’re ready; He will give it at the precise time. So don’t fret. Just keep asking!"
622,2021-09-11 07:08:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to disregard what others say about you. No matter how hard they try to twist the truth, the Almighty knows what’s in your heart. He knows your intent. He knows what the outcome will be. So don’t fret and let people have their say. In the end, only He truly matters."
623,2021-09-10 22:26:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through right now, remember, the darkest nights produce the brightest stars. The Almighty’s favour and blessings will be upon you soon. You will be rewarded for your beautiful patience. Hang on tight. Don’t you dare give up."
624,2021-09-10 06:32:32+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to grant us what we have been praying for. May You grant cure to all those who are sick; heal them and ease their suffering. May every tear that has fallen down our cheek because of worldly disappointments be equivalent to the best rewards in Your Paradise.
625,2021-09-09 18:10:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Appreciate those who do their best to forget about what they’re going through, the troubles in life &amp; put on a smile for the world to see. Appreciate how strong such people are for being able to stay positive in spite of everything! So always be kind to those who cross your path."
626,2021-09-09 10:57:15+00:00,muftimenk,"There are those who will try their best to bring you down. When they don’t succeed, they will try and dig up your past to use against you. Remember, never be a prisoner to your past. You’ve learnt your lesson and you’ve moved on. You don’t need their approval for anything."
627,2021-09-08 13:02:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of those who talk too much. They say a lot but there’s little value attached to what they’re saying. It’s all rumour, gossip and hearsay and they thrive on it. If you’re in the company of such people, pay attention to the content; what are they really saying?"
628,2021-09-07 18:47:07+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t feel guilty if you find that you’ve outgrown certain people. It happens. Not everyone will always be on the same level as you. Your job is to recognize that and to keep moving in line with what the Almighty has charted for you. Stay on course and you’ll get there!
629,2021-09-07 08:08:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t keep focusing on the hurt and the people who hurt you. It will only depress you. Instead, focus on the Almighty’s purpose for your life, which is greater than any problem or pain you might be facing. Let go of the hurt. Don’t let it control you. Let Him heal you!"
630,2021-09-06 20:49:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware of those who dilute their faith just to appease the masses. They may think they’re getting away with it but remember, the Almighty is All-Knowing. There’s no such thing as going with the flow in matters of belief. Be firm in faith. There’s no sitting on the fence."
631,2021-09-06 06:47:42+00:00,muftimenk,"This pandemic has made us more anxious about our lives than ever before,but anxiety changes nothing. Instead, hand over the anxieties to the Almighty. Keep praying, knowing that He’s in control of every aspect of our existence. Hold on tight to your faith. He’s with you always."
632,2021-09-05 20:53:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t focus on the problem. Instead, look for solutions. Often people are caught up with the magnitude of the problem, they forget who’s in charge. Learn to trust the Almighty with all your affairs even when it makes no sense. He has your back. He’s in full control."
633,2021-09-05 13:00:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't get distracted. Don’t be discouraged because the Almighty has planned your life in the most beautiful way. Such things take time so don’t rush it. He’s in full control. Your job is to wait patiently and the blessings will unfold. One by one, right before your eyes."
634,2021-09-04 19:04:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to be patient. It has many virtues and you’ll end up tasting the sweetest fruits. Instead, when you’re impatient and rash, it can cost you dearly in terms of wasted time and resources. So learn to slow down. The Almighty will grant you ease when the time is right."
635,2021-09-04 04:24:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Manage your expectations if you don’t want to end up disappointed. Don’t expect to get what you give because not everyone has a heart like yours. Nonetheless, give generously, knowing your reward is with the Almighty and not from people around you."
636,2021-09-03 14:45:48+00:00,muftimenk,Some just argue for the sake of arguing. They need to find flaws in everything or disagree just to be disagreeable. The Almighty dislikes such acts. You don’t always need to have the last say &amp; be the smartest person in the room. Choose your battles &amp; have a sense of proportion.
637,2021-09-02 23:23:48+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Bless us with more faith and hope. Many are facing tough times. Many have lost loved ones. Help us to not get frustrated and discouraged. Help us through our trials and darkest hour. We need You more than ever. Bring peace to our confusion; turn our worry into prayer.
638,2021-09-02 16:14:46+00:00,muftimenk,The death of two family members within a few hours of each other is not easy to bear. We're definitely living in very trying times. May Allah Almighty make it easy for us. Pray for the deceased. #lossofamily #sadday
639,2021-09-02 04:59:48+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty promises something, it will happen. Trust the process.  Don’t be impatient and end it prematurely because you’re not seeing the results yet. Your prayers will be answered when the time is right according to Him. Not by your judgement. But His Divine Wisdom."
640,2021-09-01 21:08:11+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty guides, no one can misguide. The changes that last are the ones that come from inside, not just because of outside pressure. You’ll know when the time is right. It comes from your heart. When you see His Signs in everything that you do. May He keep guiding us."
641,2021-09-01 14:14:52+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t follow blindly. Some of us are stressed out because we’re doing things which we see others do and we’re not getting the same results. Don’t be a copycat. What works for some may not work for you. Focus on what the Almighty wants you to do. Don’t worry about others.
642,2021-08-31 22:46:17+00:00,muftimenk,Isn't it amazing how the Almighty always grants you ease right on time? You may not have all you desire but He knows exactly how to meet your needs. He does it at the precise time when you feel you can’t handle it anymore and you want to give up! Always trust His judgement.
643,2021-08-31 05:46:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to listen more. Don’t react mindlessly. You’re allowed to disagree with others, state your opinion respectfully but NEVER get physical or violent. This quality makes us distinct from animals! So be civilised &amp; listen. It would save you from a whole lot of regret later on."
644,2021-08-30 19:18:47+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t expect people to understand you. They love to judge &amp; speak like they know what you’re going through. The truth is they don’t. No one does because they’ve not walked in your shoes. So don’t feel frustrated when you hear their comments. The Almighty knows. Smile &amp; move on.
645,2021-08-29 22:41:08+00:00,muftimenk,"You were confident that you deserved it &amp; will get it. But the Almighty didn't allow it. Sometimes He will remove, block or withhold something, not to hurt you, but to free you from that which will distance you from Him. He knows best!"
646,2021-08-29 13:42:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes we only have ourselves to blame because we are what’s making us miserable. Stop being negative and stop thinking about all that’s wrong in life. Instead, count the blessings and thank the Almighty. He will reward you with even more."
647,2021-08-29 04:23:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty can see further down the road than you can. So trust when He disrupts your plan. Trust when He says move. You’ll know what to do if you pay close attention to His signs. Things may get uncomfortable before they get better but your job is to trust Him."
648,2021-08-28 18:33:29+00:00,muftimenk,No one can block what the Almighty has in store for you. You’ve shown beautiful patience while you waited. So get ready because your favours will bring about untold blessings and you’ll be so grateful that you didn’t give up.
649,2021-08-28 10:57:36+00:00,muftimenk,Do you trust the Almighty? Or are you just paying lip service? The key to trusting Him is to stop believing that your circumstances and what you’re going through are more powerful than Him. They’re not! Nothing is greater than Him.
650,2021-08-27 23:01:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Faith is powerful. When you’re able to accept everything that happens to you as part of the Almighty’s plan, you’re on the road to something greater. Remember, one day, all the pieces of the puzzle will fit and you’ll be so pleased that you remained patient right till the end!"
651,2021-08-27 04:24:05+00:00,muftimenk,Life is hard for many. People are clinging on to hope that things will soon be better. Almighty. Help us remember that You are always with us and we’re never alone. We can’t face tomorrow with all its uncertainty on our own. We need You now more than ever. Keep our hearts firm.
652,2021-08-26 18:41:21+00:00,muftimenk,We often hear people say ‘forgive &amp; forget’ &amp; move on. There is some truth in that but let’s give it another interpretation. How about ‘forget it enough to get over it; but make sure you remember it enough when you need to so it doesn’t happen again’. Learn from the experience.
653,2021-08-25 22:41:46+00:00,muftimenk,You may be suffering inside but don’t keep it all bottled up in there. Share it with the Almighty. Don’t share it with others. Tell Him everything. He’s the only One who will listen and respond. He’s the only One who can and will give you that inner peace you long and crave for.
654,2021-08-24 21:37:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Never think that the Almighty won’t answer your prayers. Remember, your prayers matter. He hears them; all of them &amp; He will answer according to His timing. Our timing isn’t His timing. For us, His timing often feels like a long delay. But His timing is always perfect."
655,2021-08-24 12:14:52+00:00,muftimenk,Why do we have the tendency to stereotype people &amp; think like we know it all? Why do we often feel like we can speak with authority on someone’s life? How can we when we’ve not experienced what the other person has; we’ve not walked in his shoes? Learn to be more compassionate.
656,2021-08-23 23:46:42+00:00,muftimenk,"All that you’ve been praying for will come to you one day. Your life now may seem like a big waiting game, but understand that everything that happens until that point is taking shape in preparation for that day. Are you going to worry or are you going to trust the Almighty?"
657,2021-08-23 09:51:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you looking for the formula for success in this world and the next? Trust the Almighty. Make Him your priority, not people. Stay the course no matter what challenges you encounter. Keep the faith. Pray. Believe that He wants only good for you. Never give up!"
658,2021-08-23 00:50:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Many would go to other people and pour their hearts out when faced with a challenge. Many forget the “Almighty factor” and some don’t even turn to Him. Change that mindset. Remember, He can do in a second what no man can do in a lifetime! What are you waiting for? Turn to Him!"
659,2021-08-22 16:35:21+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want the Almighty to help you then help others. Remember, He’s the Owner of everything. Whatever you have, comes from Him. As much as He gives, He can also take away in the blink of an eye. So be wary how you treat people. He’s aware and knows everything that you do."
660,2021-08-22 00:35:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep your distance from those who constantly want to update you on situations you have outgrown. Tell them politely, you’re no longer interested. If they cannot respect that, it’s time to let them go, minimising future contact. Remember, your peace is everything."
661,2021-08-21 15:41:35+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll never find true happiness if it’s tied to material things. That new car won’t make you happy. A huge mansion, the latest smartphone won’t either. True joy &amp; contentment will not be found externally. Sort things out inside you &amp; you’ll start feeling better about yourself."
662,2021-08-20 23:08:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is fragile. This pandemic has given new meaning to this phrase. Today you’re here, tomorrow you’re gone. The disease doesn’t discriminate. So take precautions; don’t stress about your worldly affairs. Take it in your stride. You’ll be spending forever in the Hereafter!"
663,2021-08-20 09:38:26+00:00,muftimenk,"There are some who choose to see the ugliness in things. They believe the whole world is out to get them. Don’t! Choose to see beauty instead. Positivity. You’ll have a different outlook towards life. In fact, when you’re positive, good will follow you wherever you go."
664,2021-08-20 00:04:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Don’t allow doubts to settle in our hearts. The uncertainty in the world &amp; the troubling times we’re facing are causing distraction &amp; threatening our peace. Help us stay firm in faith, always trusting Your Plan. Help us see things in perspective. Keep our focus on You."
665,2021-08-19 05:55:49+00:00,muftimenk,It’s human nature to judge others &amp; vindicate ourselves. Pointing the finger at others &amp; not ourselves is a sin. We never know the true circumstances around people. We have never walked in their shoes. Protect ourselves from such wrongdoing! Focus on our own shortcomings.
666,2021-08-18 22:11:14+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how difficult the road ahead, don’t quit.  The minute you’re ready to quit is usually the minute right before the miracle unfolds. We’ve seen it happen far too many times. So stay firm, trust the process and don’t give up."
667,2021-08-18 11:48:56+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t believe what you see on social media. You’re NOT behind. You’re exactly where you’re supposed to be. You’re exactly where the Almighty wants you to be. Stop berating yourself because you’re not what you see others show on their reel. Focus on your journey. He’s with you.
668,2021-08-18 04:26:44+00:00,muftimenk,"At times you’ll feel like giving up. You’ll feel like you can’t make it. But you can and you will get through all your trials. As long as you’re steadfast and trust the Almighty, He will see you through it. Remember, whatever you sow in tears, you will reap in joy!"
669,2021-08-17 21:17:54+00:00,muftimenk,"If you could see the entire plan the Almighty has for you, would you still complain? He is indeed the Best Planner. If you could see the end results of all your trials, would you still be miserable? Remember, there’s a silver lining in every challenge. Keep going. Trust Him."
670,2021-08-16 22:38:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do, don’t hurt others. When you try to hurt those who hurt you, you’re only hurting yourself. Because it’s not in your character to act in an ugly manner. What you need to do is forgive and move on. Easier said than done for most. But only good can overcome evil."
671,2021-08-16 15:49:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be fooled by social media! No one lives a perfect life. Not many will put their bad days on their show reel. The days when things didn’t work out, when the heart was broken, when feeling lost &amp; alone, when filled with self-doubts &amp; unanswered questions. So don’t be envious!"
672,2021-08-15 22:07:30+00:00,muftimenk,"How often do we forget the big picture? We look at the nitty gritty. We want everything to be perfect. We want everything to go our way.  We are always restless, looking for warts and blemishes. Stop it! Enjoy what we have and all the blessings the Almighty has bestowed on us!"
673,2021-08-14 22:54:39+00:00,muftimenk,You can be a kind and caring person who respects people’s needs and still set healthy boundaries for your own well-being. Learn when to walk away and when to work things out. You can’t control how people treat you but you can control what you tolerate.
674,2021-08-14 05:17:01+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s a reason why the Almighty is making us wait. It’s never to make it hard on us but to develop our character. Remember, patience doesn’t happen overnight. It needs to be nurtured. It takes time. So have a good attitude while you wait. He has promised great rewards!"
675,2021-08-13 18:39:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Trust the Almighty to give you things that you didn’t even know you needed or wanted in your life. Don’t forget He knows you better than you know yourself. Remember, He made you. He will give you whatever you’ve asked for when the time is right. In the meantime, be patient."
676,2021-08-13 05:25:08+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty! Keep us safe &amp; surround us with those who will constantly remind us of You. Help us choose the right company like-minded  people who will not distract us away from our journey towards You. Guide us in all that we do; all the way to Paradise. Aameen.
677,2021-08-12 13:17:27+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to cut out the noise around you. Calm down and see things in perspective. Reset your faith! Everything that is going on in your life will soon make sense. Don’t let Satan mess with your mind and tell you otherwise. Have beautiful patience and the Almighty will guide you!
678,2021-08-12 02:02:57+00:00,muftimenk,"When people hurt you, most would try &amp; hurt them back. Before you do that, just think for a moment what their lives must be like. Would you want to be in their place? Would you like to have their mindset; do what they did? If the answer is no, let it go. Say a prayer for them!"
679,2021-08-11 13:34:02+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be upset when your work is not acknowledged. It’s human nature to want recognition. Sometimes even a thank you will suffice. But it may not be forthcoming. The Almighty knows what you’ve done and how much effort and sacrifice went into it. Isn’t that the best thing for you?
680,2021-08-11 04:37:15+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty knows what you’re doing. He knows exactly what you’re going through. He knows you never gave up. You kept going even when the going was tough. You did your best. You had ultimate patience. You depended on Him every step of the way. And your reward is with Him alone!
681,2021-08-10 22:44:11+00:00,muftimenk,So your life’s a mess and everything seems topsy turvy. Do your best still under the circumstances but understand the Almighty’s plan. Sometimes He makes things fall all the way apart just to come perfectly together at the right time and the right place. Trust Him!
682,2021-08-10 04:28:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Is your heart at ease? A diseased heart won’t be at ease. If you want to feel the sweetness of worship, cleanse your heart. Get rid of pride, hatred, envy &amp; anything that gets in the way of being fully focused on the Almighty. It won’t happen overnight but you’ll get there."
683,2021-08-09 11:20:11+00:00,muftimenk,This is life in a nutshell. Do good and people will talk. Do bad and people will talk. So let them talk. Live your life the best way possible. Life’s really too short to be worrying about people who are jealous of you and will talk behind your back.
684,2021-08-08 21:29:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, every good or bad thing that happens in your life is not for public consumption. Why would you want to share it on social media? Why give people additional fodder? Learn to keep things private between you &amp; the Almighty. He’s the only One you need to confide in."
685,2021-08-08 05:15:36+00:00,muftimenk,Are you feeling unsettled &amp; always unhappy? Happiness will not come to those who are never grateful for the Almighty’s blessings. This world is not a place where you get exactly what you want. There are many out there who will never have what you have; so be thankful always.
686,2021-08-07 21:02:21+00:00,muftimenk,"You think there’s no solution; no way out of your problems. You feel almost certain that it’s a dead end. You forget you have the Lord of the Worlds, the Owner of Miracles. Remember, don’t consider your circumstances, consider what the Almighty can do. Nothing is impossible."
687,2021-08-07 07:04:55+00:00,muftimenk,Envy is a bad word. It makes you wonder why everyone else seems happy but you. You see this on social media &amp; you’re finding it hard to come to terms with it. You can’t achieve the lifestyle you want but you see others have. You need to get back to real life. Stop the comparison.
688,2021-08-07 00:41:30+00:00,muftimenk,Not everyone will want the best for you. Understand the reality. The same people who wanted you to rise can feel deflated by your success. Don’t be surprised if their cheers turn to boos. Some don’t like seeing others do better than them because it shows up their weakness.
689,2021-08-06 06:54:36+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will never fail you. He’ll restore everything you lost. During your life, you will, perhaps, lose your job, things &amp; people. Trust His Plan. It may not be apparent now, but will be clearly revealed in due course. Whoever &amp; whatever’s meant to be there will stay."

691,2021-08-05 17:09:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you often wonder if the Almighty hears your cries and pleas? Why is He taking so long to respond? We’ve wept, we’ve begged, cried our hearts out, but still He’s not answering. Why? Because He operates on His schedule, not yours. But remember, your patience is your Paradise!"
692,2021-08-04 22:09:29+00:00,muftimenk,Waiting on the Almighty is always worth it. Wait patiently. Don’t settle for anything less. He always has the best plan in store for you. Trust Him. Faith is forceful. Believe that it will happen. May be not today or tomorrow. But it will happen; eventually.
693,2021-08-04 00:25:58+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to pick on what’s wrong and what’s not going well in life but it takes firm faith in the Almighty to see positive vibes in everything. Unfortunately, most tend to focus on flaws. We have become expert nitpickers overlooking the good in most things. Change your outlook."
694,2021-08-02 09:50:28+00:00,muftimenk,"If the company you keep doesn’t care much about others, shows no empathy and compassion, then it’s time you relook the people you call friends. Change your circle of friends if you have to. You’ll see life from a different lens and you’ll be thankful you made the change!"
695,2021-08-02 00:12:38+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s ok to take time out. Your mind too needs a break; not just your physical body. With so much going on around us, it’s easy to get caught up with things &amp; overlook your mental health. Don’t feel guilty about having “me” time to restore your energy &amp; refocus your mind!"
696,2021-08-01 22:34:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Today, many are sad and disillusioned because they fail to appreciate what the Almighty has bestowed on them. They scoff at His blessings because they are too busy admiring the fake life portrayed by some on social media. Remember to be grateful, before it’s taken away from you!"
697,2021-08-01 06:16:49+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has blessed each and everyone of us with unique talents and abilities. Never underestimate the power of these blessings.

698,2021-07-31 16:25:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Never leave the Almighty out of the equation. On bad days, trust Him. On good days, glorify Him. On difficult and confusing days, seek His help. Remember, He is always there for you. He will provide for you and protect you. He won’t forsake you."
699,2021-07-31 05:39:57+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have firm faith, you don’t doubt or wonder what’s going on. You don’t worry about what will happen tomorrow.

700,2021-07-30 21:16:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful how you use social media. It’s becoming more hostile recently. Never forget that social media is a tool. We decide how the tool is used. Use it to spread goodness &amp;  positivity; the ripple effects can be tremendous. Avoid bad words, no matter what they say about you."
701,2021-07-30 04:18:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You to grant complete cure to those facing health challenges. Comfort and heal those who are hurting. Grant ease to those who are prone to overthinking, anxiety, doubt and worry. Fill our hearts with love for You and help us engage in acts that You love!"
702,2021-07-29 20:41:42+00:00,muftimenk,Life’s a process. It’s not something you can rush according to your schedule. Some parts of your journey will be more challenging than the rest. But you have to persevere and embrace every part of it. Do it with beautiful patience. The lessons learned are invaluable!
703,2021-07-29 04:36:07+00:00,muftimenk,"People will talk. No matter what you say or do, you can’t stop them from talking. So let them talk because the Almighty will protect your reputation. As long as you’ve done right and not hurt or harmed  anyone, don’t worry. He will be on your side and keep you safe."
704,2021-07-28 19:11:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t beat yourself up for the mistakes you made &amp; past decisions that didn’t work out. Instead, gather the lessons learnt from such situations &amp; become a better person. No lesson the Almighty sends your way is ever wasted. They’re teaching moments to strengthen you. Thank Him!"
705,2021-07-27 20:36:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Gratitude is key. Take nothing for granted. You never know when you'll have it for the last time. Life’s a precious gift, cherish every moment while you can. It’s truly such a blessing to be alive; to be able to impact so many lives. You’ll never know whose life you’re touching!"
706,2021-07-27 10:51:01+00:00,muftimenk,Accept what happened in the past. Learn from it and move on so it doesn’t spoil your present. The Almighty’s plan is always the best; move ahead knowing that you have much in store for you. Don’t worry about what others say. That’s not your priority. Stop overthinking and live!
707,2021-07-26 22:04:23+00:00,muftimenk,"When you open your mouth to speak, only two things can happen. Your words will either be  for you or against you. There’s nothing in between. With that in mind, how can you be so negligent and just shoot your mouth off at anything &amp; everything? Watch your words before you utter."
708,2021-07-26 09:23:18+00:00,muftimenk,When you put your hope in people or whatever else. watch out. You’re going to be disappointed. Redirect that hope to the Almighty and you won’t be disappointed. He’s there for you. He won’t let you down and He always wants the best for you! Without a doubt!
709,2021-07-25 19:10:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Such is life. Sometimes friends &amp; loved ones are the ones who hurt us most. Considering the nature of these relationships, some incidents can leave a deep wound, threatening to uproot friendships &amp; harm family ties. Turn to the Almighty; only He can help you heal and forgive."
710,2021-07-24 20:08:41+00:00,muftimenk,Just because they’re in your circle doesn’t mean they’re your real friends. Be careful who you befriend. Just because they hang out with you doesn’t mean they won’t stab you in the back. Pay attention to how they behave and react. You’ll be able to pick up the signs!
711,2021-07-24 10:55:48+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty can change your entire life in the blink of an eye. Have firm faith that He won’t burden you with more than you can handle.

712,2021-07-24 04:35:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty gives you a new beginning, don’t repeat the same mistake. Instead have a heart filled with gratitude and thank Him for the second chance you’ve been given. Remember, not everyone gets it!"
713,2021-07-23 04:27:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. You’re the only One who knows the trials and tribulations we are facing in this life. Only You know our pain &amp; discomfort.

714,2021-07-22 17:59:53+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what difficulties you’re facing, know that the Almighty has your back. He’s there even when things seem hopeless. He’s there even when the circumstances are darker than you ever imagined. He’s there when everyone has given up on you. Place your trust and hope in Him!"
715,2021-07-22 04:37:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is short. Instead of quibbling over petty issues, make it a point to touch lives &amp; hearts whenever you get the opportunity. Give, forgive &amp; apologise. If you find difficulty doing it, make a commitment &amp; start today. Focus your resources on things that matter."
716,2021-07-21 22:34:27+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t become cynical. Don’t let this world harden you. Don’t allow your heart to stop feeling for others. Let people be mean and hateful. That’s not who you are and you don’t have to join in. You remain kind and sincere. Protect your heart and your inner peace at all times.
717,2021-07-21 16:30:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Good things take time and patience. Stop expecting everything to fall into place in a day. Be realistic. Life is a process. Take it one day at a time, one step at a time. Be a good person. Do good; do what’s right and things will work in your favour. Above all, be patient."

719,2021-07-21 06:21:33+00:00,muftimenk,Satan’s goal is to create division and confusion. So be careful when confronted with situations which could potentially go that way. Be cautious and guarded in your reaction and don’t fall for the bait. He is waiting to see you mess up. Don’t give him that pleasure.
720,2021-07-20 21:16:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The sacrifice on #Eid is not mere slaughter but to show gratitude to the Almighty for His blessings &amp; a means to feed the less fortunate. I wish you all a Blessed Eidul Ad-ha.

724,2021-07-18 21:10:33+00:00,muftimenk,"They know they’re wrong; but some people find it so hard to apologize! It’s to do with their pride. You can never get them to say sorry, no matter how obvious their mistake or wrongdoing. Beware such pride; for even the size of a mustard seed can bar you from Paradise!"
725,2021-07-18 07:38:04+00:00,muftimenk,Take social media with a pinch of salt. Don’t let it determine your identity. The Almighty doesn’t care if you have one follower or a million. He looks at your heart and deeds. So don’t get caught up in the social media rat race. Use it wisely to promote what’s good &amp; wholesome!
726,2021-07-17 19:31:15+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t focus on the negatives. Don't let the rejection from a few make you miserable and stop you from seeing the acceptance of many! Such is life; you can’t please everyone so don’t even try. Focus on who is for you instead of those against you. That’s the way forward!
727,2021-07-17 06:22:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When you believe, it doesn’t mean the road ahead is smooth all the way. Far from it. Expect the Almighty to test you if you’re indeed true to your word. Remember, faith is not the belief that He will do what you want, it is the confidence in knowing that He will do what’s best."

766,2021-06-27 20:31:31+00:00,muftimenk,Many of us are fooled into believing that we have time. So we put off till tomorrow what we were supposed to do today. Many thought the same. But death overtook them. Don’t lose out. Let this world run its race. We run after the Hereafter which is eternal. May we all get there!
767,2021-06-27 05:03:52+00:00,muftimenk,"There are people out there whose sole aim is to hurt you with their words or comments. Don’t let them affect you. Ignore the noise. It’s not easy but consider this; show them you’re NOT affected by their remarks. When you’re able to do that, you’ve made them totally powerless!"
768,2021-06-26 16:26:21+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how much you’ve endured, no matter what has happened, remember, good is always around the corner. Dawn will  emerge. The sun will shine again. Your most valuable takeaway will be the lessons learnt along the way. Use them to propel you to the next stage of life."
769,2021-06-26 04:25:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Only a genuine heart can celebrate other people's success. Learn to be happy for them, even before you experience your share of blessings. Don’t begrudge others. You can ask the Almighty to bless you with the same or more. But never be mean and wish ill upon people."
770,2021-06-25 22:17:23+00:00,muftimenk,"You hear this often enough. “Everyone's doing it, you'll regret it. You're still young, have fun"" - the familiar whisperings of Satan. Protect yourself from his tricks. Don’t go down that path. Don’t give in. Stay firm. Keep a level head and exercise self-restraint!"
771,2021-06-25 05:14:09+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t rush the Almighty. Don’t rush what He has planned for you. Don’t rush through your supplication thinking that He will abide by your timing. No! Your Creator has His own timing. Trust Him and the process. Learn to be patient. It will be worth it in the end!
772,2021-06-24 23:21:25+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We’re all broken in one way or another. Our energy is sagging &amp; our motivation is lagging. The pressures of life often get the better of us; we feel helpless at times. We know You have our backs. Grant us the strength to keep going &amp; to overcome obstacles in our path.
773,2021-06-24 12:02:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t take people for granted. That’s right. Don’t. No matter how nice people are, remember everyone has limits. Don’t cross that limit. Don’t make unrealistic demands on others because one day, they will snap! Sooner or later, they will. Don’t forget we’re only human!"
774,2021-06-23 19:30:52+00:00,muftimenk,There’s a reason for everything that happens in your life. The Almighty will always put you where you need to be. Trust His plans though you may not understand it at that moment. Stop listening to people’s opinions of what’s going on. Have faith in the journey. He has your back!
775,2021-06-23 05:05:57+00:00,muftimenk,"When you're grateful, the Almighty opens doors no man can shut. Gratitude is key. Never fail to appreciate what He has blessed you with. Use the blessings in His cause and He will grant you more. Do your best in your worldly affairs and the Hereafter. He will reward your effort!"
776,2021-06-22 22:32:04+00:00,muftimenk,Feeling stuck in life? Do you keep going round in circles? Then you have to stop doing what you’re doing &amp; take stock of your life. Reevaluate your priorities &amp; shift your mindset. Only then can you get out of the repetitive rut you’re in. Seek your strength from the Almighty.
777,2021-06-22 05:00:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Train yourself to look at your trials in a positive light. Struggle &amp; strife are part and parcel of life. So take them in your stride when they arrive at your door. Remember, nothing lasts. So you can choose to view your trials with hope or you’ll be swept away by your emotions."
778,2021-06-21 23:02:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be so hard on yourself. At the end of the day, remind yourself that you did the best you could today, and that is good enough. The Almighty is not looking for perfection. Far from it. As long as you’re consistently trying and putting in real effort, that’s all that matters."
779,2021-06-21 12:20:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Maturity has nothing to do with age. It’s a state of mind. So don’t be fooled into thinking otherwise. When you’re able to be patient in an impatient society, when you can walk away from things that disturb your peace, when you do what’s right &amp; ignore what’s not, you’ve matured."
780,2021-06-20 12:48:38+00:00,muftimenk,The pain you’ve endured has a purpose. The Almighty will grant you more strength &amp; perseverance if you have unwavering faith! So be grateful for the trials that He sends your way. He sends the toughest trials to His best soldiers. Look at them positively. Bear good patience.
781,2021-06-20 04:27:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Blessings are trials in disguise. Wealth. Fame. Social status. Children. Good looks. They’re all trials. The Almighty’s watching how you live with these blessings. If they draw you closer to Him, you’ve won. If they cause you to drift away from Him, you’ve lost the plot!"
782,2021-06-19 22:08:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Give generously. No matter how small you think it is, every little bit helps. Every little bit can make a difference to those in need. Remember, a small charity that comes from the heart holds more weight with the Almighty than a big one done with so much noise and fanfare."
783,2021-06-19 09:17:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever the Almighty has planned for you is for you alone. No one and nothing can stop it from coming to you. Just keep believing! Just keep trusting. It will unfold in due course, according to His timing, not yours. Remember, with Him nothing is impossible!"
784,2021-06-18 20:40:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't let your sins drown you. Don’t think that your sins are the size of mountains &amp; there’s no way out. Never lose hope in the Almighty’s mercy. Just turn to your Lord with sincere, heartfelt repentance. He loves those who repent. Peace will prevail in your heart!"
785,2021-06-18 03:38:22+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant ease to those who’ve lost loved ones. Surround them with good company who will offer words of comfort &amp; solace during difficult times. Remove the heaviness from their hearts &amp; let peace reign again. May we all be reunited with our loved ones in Paradise. Aameen.
786,2021-06-17 22:54:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop judging people. That’s the Almighty’s job not  yours. Instead look at people with eyes of compassion &amp; empathy. Remember, whatever happened to them could happen to you. The tables could turn. He will show you how quickly you could be in their same shoes. Stay humble always!"
787,2021-06-17 08:01:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Losing a loved one is not easy. Heartbreaks are not easy. They all take a toll on your physical and mental being. So be patient with yourself. Take time to heal but remember that whatever the Almighty takes away from you, He will surely replace it with something even better."
788,2021-06-16 21:38:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Words are powerful. They can make or break someone. So when you’re conveying a message you heard to someone else, be careful not to distort the original meaning. Some do this intentionally to create mischief between people. Save yourself and stay away from such sinful acts."
789,2021-06-16 04:41:45+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of social media, pay close attention to your value system. It can be easily eroded if you don’t have a firm grounding. Don’t be in awe of anyone showing off worldly possessions online. Instead, focus on his/her character &amp; good moral principles; they're worth far more"
790,2021-06-15 21:22:55+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty’s in charge of every aspect of our existence. The sooner we understand that, the better life becomes. So never stop trusting Him &amp; believing in His Miracles. When feeling low &amp; despondent, the next minute He could be turning things around completely in our favour!"
791,2021-06-15 03:51:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Be the first to be kind. Don’t wait for someone else to do it first. You never know the real impact you have on someone. That smile, a good word, a helping hand can all turn a person’s life around. So don’t hesitate. Do it because acts of kindness have tremendous ripple effect!"
792,2021-06-14 06:38:50+00:00,muftimenk,"At the end of the day, remember everyone is struggling. Yes. Everyone. In one way or another. We’re all tired to the core. So let’s be kind to those around us. It costs nothing. But it could mean a lot to someone. Go on and make a difference in someone’s life today."
793,2021-06-13 20:26:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When things are good for you, be prepared for some who will start causing havoc in your life. They will cast doubts over what you’ve done. That’s human nature. Don’t worry about them as long as you’ve done the right thing. Focus on the Almighty. Let Him deal with the rest!"
794,2021-06-13 05:33:33+00:00,muftimenk,"People will hurt you. Without a doubt. Even family members can hurt you. But remember, you’re responsible for how long you allow what hurt you to haunt you. The truth is you’ll never find happiness until your heart is attached to the One who made you. Anything else falls short!"
795,2021-06-12 18:19:21+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste time chasing after the world and its trappings. We will never be able to catch up because it will always be ahead of us. The problem comes when we make it our goal and not the means to the ultimate goal. Get the priorities right!
796,2021-06-11 20:55:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you among those who feel threatened when others shine their light on the rest of the world? Some think if you shine bright, it somehow dims theirs &amp; gives them less opportunity to find their own success. The Almighty has given all a chance to be successful. Everyone of us!"
797,2021-06-11 08:35:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Help us heal from all the violence &amp; hatred that’s been happening lately. May we pursue justice not revenge, peace &amp; not more violence. May healing come from our brokenness. May strength come from our vulnerability. Grant us ease, comfort us &amp; protect us all. Aameen."
798,2021-06-11 05:02:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Mufti of the MJC of South Africa, Ml Taha Karan has passed away. A very great loss for the Ummah. He was THE leader in promoting responsible behaviour during Covid-19. May Allah Almighty forgive his shortcomings, grant him Paradise and make it easy for his loved ones. Aameen."
799,2021-06-10 18:55:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Time is one of the greatest blessings from the Almighty. Respect it and spend it wisely because once gone, you won’t get it back. Some don’t respect your time, because they are trying to satisfy their own priorities so when people don’t respect your time, stop giving it to them!"
800,2021-06-10 08:18:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s face it. There are things in life we wished we had done differently. It’s bound to happen. We’re humans. So as soon as you realize you've made a poor decision, it's not too late to correct it. You're not stuck in any situation as long as you refuse to accept that you are!"
801,2021-06-09 21:21:14+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in a sad world. That’s the reality. We have people hating on others for being successful. They judge &amp; criticize those who are trying to do better, get closer to the Almighty. The list goes on. Why can’t we mind our own business &amp; just let people live? Is that so hard?"
802,2021-06-09 05:33:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When you let your emotions get the better of you, be careful. When you start insulting others &amp; calling them names, like dog, donkey etc, be careful. Are we not from the same species? Do we not share the same Creator? Remember, all the negativity you exude, will come back to you!"
803,2021-06-08 16:06:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t tell the story if you only know part of it. It’s a huge sin to make up or embellish stories. Besides, one sided stories are dangerous. Only fools would answer before they know the whole matter. Protect your tongue from becoming a gossip funnel. Fear the Almighty’s wrath."
804,2021-06-07 21:44:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Always ask the Almighty to help us focus on things that are good, pure, honorable, righteous, excellent &amp; worthy of praise. Abandon thoughts that cloud our judgement, cause doubt &amp; make us think ill of others! They’re the work of Satan. Good thoughts make all the difference!"
805,2021-06-07 06:51:25+00:00,muftimenk,There’ll always be brickbats and naysayers in life. That’s the nature of man. Always interested in other people’s lives. Learn to focus on your own journey. You will never reach your destination if you keep stopping and throwing stones at every dog that barks. Stay alert.
806,2021-06-06 23:51:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you often distracted? In this age of constant distraction, focus is crucial in our relationship with the Almighty. This focus is not only meant for our daily prayers but should cover every aspect of our lives. Living a distracted life leads nowhere. You’ll fall prey to Satan."
807,2021-06-06 07:07:40+00:00,muftimenk,You may think it's easier to stay where you are than to follow a new path. Fear will make you feel this way. Satan will do his utmost to distract you if you’re trying to get close to the Almighty. Learn his tricks &amp; stay firm in your journey. Seek your strength from the Almighty!
808,2021-06-05 23:21:12+00:00,muftimenk,Why do we complain constantly? There’s a simple and fundamental reason for it: we lack a sense of contentment. The truth is we are often dissatisfied &amp; this has taken over the place of contentment in our hearts. So everything that we say is a reflection of how we feel!
809,2021-06-05 11:10:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t stress too much about your worldly affairs. Life is fragile. Today you’re here, tomorrow you’re gone. Take it in your stride. You’ll be spending forever in the Hereafter. Focus on doing good always to secure a better life. Satan will distract you, so remain vigilant!"
810,2021-06-04 16:45:01+00:00,muftimenk,"It doesn’t matter what they think, it doesn’t matter what they say. If your intention is good, the results will be good eventually. The Almighty will take care of that. Don’t complicate things. Stay focused in your efforts. Let them not distract you from your main goal!"
811,2021-06-04 04:37:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. May we never be among those who are like leaking buckets. People who follow up their good deeds with bad ones. May we never be among those who pray, fast &amp; give charity but curse, swear, gossip &amp; backbite without batting an eyelid. Protect us from such behaviour!"
812,2021-06-03 20:11:16+00:00,muftimenk,"When you supplicate, do it wholeheartedly. Don’t pay lip service. Remember, you’re asking the One who made you; the One in complete control of your existence. Let your emotions flow. Beg. Cry. Whatever it takes to show Him that you need Him. Above all, trust that He will answer!"
813,2021-06-02 22:40:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Life comes at us fast &amp; will throw up many challenges. Occasionally, it will hit us so hard that we feel like giving up. But remember the Almighty’s promise that with hardship comes ease; that trouble doesn’t last always. This is just a season; don’t quit. It can only get better!"
814,2021-06-02 06:25:11+00:00,muftimenk,Work hard on your marriage. Don't give up so easily unless you've exhausted all avenues of reconciliation. Everyone goes through challenges. It’s part of life. Choosing to divorce without seriously trying to resolve matters is regrettable. Divorce should only be as a last resort.
815,2021-06-02 03:19:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because some people treat you badly, it doesn’t give you the right to do the same to others. You can break the cycle of negativity &amp; abuse. Instead of feeling angry &amp; hateful, learn positive &amp; empowering behaviour. Focus on your reaction rather than the behaviour of others."
816,2021-06-01 20:45:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit worrying about the past. Things happen for a reason. The Almighty never wastes a moment of what you’ve experienced. What you went through before can be the catalyst for change that’s needed tomorrow. Remember, if the Almighty is for you, nobody can be against you!"
817,2021-06-01 11:51:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to admit your mistakes. Eat humble pie, swallow your pride and know that you’ll be respected more for it. Many fail to understand this. The earlier you admit that you have done wrong, the more time you have to learn and grow from them. It’s a lesson well learned!"
818,2021-06-01 00:17:54+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what you’re going through in life, always have faith in the Almighty. Trust that He wants the best for you, even if He doesn't give you exactly what you want, He's always taking care of your needs. You might not see it right away, but eventually it’ll all make sense."
819,2021-05-31 15:53:29+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re miserable because your dream was shattered to smithereens, here’s some precious advice.  Even champions have broken dreams but the difference is they aren’t afraid to pick the pieces up and start all over again; often with resounding success all round!"
820,2021-05-30 16:31:09+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s one thing about the Almighty you need to understand. When He sees you doing your utmost, going out of your way to please Him, He will bless you in every way. Stay focused in your journey. Have unflinching faith in your Lord. He’s the Best Disposer of your affairs!"
821,2021-05-29 22:58:27+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful when nursing a broken heart. You may think you’ve reached the end of the road &amp; you feel empty. Satan is an opportunist. He will jump in to cause doubt &amp; unleash evil thoughts; strive to block him out. Turn to the Almighty. Seek His help. Only He can heal you!
822,2021-05-29 08:11:02+00:00,muftimenk,"All the good you’ve done, no matter how small, will come back to you. So don’t despair but give generously. Act with kindness. It’s contagious. Do things with a pure heart and leave the rest to the Almighty. He’s All-Knowing!"
823,2021-05-28 23:45:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Persistence has its rewards. So when you feel like giving up, keep going. Remember, it’s darkest before dawn. Don’t let the pressures of life set you back. Pressure can either break you or make you; the choice is yours to make. Think carefully before making your decision!"
824,2021-05-28 09:17:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We’re facing tough tests right now. Grant us strength and endurance to go through them. Many are feeling hopeless at the moment. We know giving up is not an option. Keep us steadfast &amp; firm in faith. No matter what's happening, we know You always have our backs!"
825,2021-05-27 15:21:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t mind those who constantly criticize you. They’re actually the ones who dare not admit that they've certain flaws. That’s why they will strongly defend themselves if you tried to help them. Pray for them, and take whatever they say with a huge pinch of salt!"
826,2021-05-27 03:32:56+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful of the people you allow into your life. Be even more careful what you share with them. People love to talk. So don’t give them that additional platform by baring your all. Keeping unnecessary people out of your business can help eliminate a lot of problems later on.
827,2021-05-26 13:50:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Protecting your gaze should be taken seriously. Why? Because what the heart sees, the mind preserves. Letting the gaze go astray makes the heart blind to distinguishing between truth &amp; falsehood. It also cloaks the heart with darkness while lowering the gaze clothes it in light!"
828,2021-05-26 05:34:03+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty may shut a door only because He’s about to open a new one. But we mourn the closed door &amp; forget that He only has the best plans for us. So don’t get discouraged when things suddenly change. You think He’s taken away the blessing but new doors are about to open!
829,2021-05-25 11:19:12+00:00,muftimenk,Never curse whatever you’re going through. It shows how the Almighty is indeed the Best of Planners. We intended and He decided how things should progress. Purify your intentions. Trials should make you aware of our short life here; perhaps become woke from years of slumber!
830,2021-05-25 04:34:11+00:00,muftimenk,Never doubt that the Almighty knows what’s going on. He knows our struggles. He has seen the tears &amp; heard our prayers. The best we can hope for is to believe that relief is near. He has promised us. All our suffering &amp; sorrows will be forgotten once we lay our eyes on Paradise!
831,2021-05-24 23:33:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you facing what you think is a dead end? When everything seems to grind to a halt and you start thinking that you’re a loser, think again.  Is there any limit to the Almighty’s Prowess? He’s the Lord of the Worlds. Do you think He will abandon you now? Trust Him."
832,2021-05-23 23:33:02+00:00,muftimenk,Never doubt that the Almighty knows what’s going on. He knows our struggles. He has seen the tears &amp; heard our prayers. The best we can hope for is to believe that relief is near. He has promised us. All our  suffering &amp; sorrows will be forgotten once we lay our eyes on Paradise!
833,2021-05-23 12:53:04+00:00,muftimenk,"How do you react to those who’ve wronged you? Two wrongs do not make a right. You can’t be mean, angry or bitter &amp; expect goodness in return. Don’t become obsessed with revenge. Let it go and let the Almighty handle it. Be the better, kinder person always. Rise above it all."
834,2021-05-23 04:44:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Know when to forgive people, but also be wise enough to know that they don't always need to play an active role in your life after that. The Almighty might send you signs how to handle such people. If He’s telling you to let them go, stop holding on to them. Read His signs!"
835,2021-05-22 22:47:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is like that. People will cause you pain, hurt you, put you down, make you feel bad about yourself, as if you’re the bad one! It’s how you react that will determine the outcome. They are powerless until you choose to empower them. Don’t give them the ammunition they need!"
836,2021-05-22 11:26:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t expect that apology. You’re going to be disappointed because it may never come. Forgive them anyway. Remember, there’ll always be those who are unwilling to accept that they did something wrong. It takes maturity to admit your mistakes. So move on for you, not them!"
837,2021-05-21 22:48:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Moving on may be the best thing at times. It doesn’t mean you’re forgetting, it simply means you choose happiness over hurt. When you forgive someone, it doesn’t give them a free pass. It gives you a free pass to move on. Be kind to yourself. Don’t compromise your peace of mind."
838,2021-05-21 14:29:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Faith is trusting &amp; believing that the Almighty has your back no matter what you’re going through. Even when you can’t comprehend what’s going on, you trust Him. You know He will get you out of unfavorable situations. Best motto to live by; do your best, leave the rest to Him!"
839,2021-05-21 04:12:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Surround everyone affected by the ongoing calamity with Your Mercy &amp; Protection. Comfort those who grieve. We won’t give up hope. We know even in the darkest hours, You’re always with us. You’re our refuge &amp; strength. Aameen."
840,2021-05-20 22:15:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When you connect with the Almighty, you are blessed. Your heart is tranquil. Hope never leaves your side. You’re always positive when life throws a challenge. You never give up because you believe brighter days are ahead and You trust His Plan for your journey through life!"
841,2021-05-19 14:47:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t lose focus when you’re being tested. If you let your guard down &amp; let Satan mess with your mind, you’re going to lose the plot &amp; end up miserable. Remember, where you choose to focus is where your life will head. Keep the Almighty in sight always! You’ll emerge the winner!"
842,2021-05-18 19:32:55+00:00,muftimenk,Take care of your thoughts. The Almighty has given us the capacity to go through tough trials &amp; challenges. It’s when you crowd your mind with irrational thoughts &amp; imagined battles that life becomes a burden. Stay focused &amp; seek your strength from Him. He knows your struggle!
843,2021-05-17 21:36:24+00:00,muftimenk,Pray for others. Pray when you feel hopeless. Pray when you feel hopeful. Pray under all circumstances. Prayer is powerful. Pray and let the Almighty do the rest. He’s Omnipotent. He knows. He hears. He sees. He cares. You’re never alone. He’s always there for you.
844,2021-05-17 05:28:16+00:00,muftimenk,Remember to thank the Almighty daily for every new day He allows us to face. At times we forget that even another breath of fresh air is a blessing. Forgive us for taking things for granted. May we always be mindful of our blessings and be reminded to count them every day.
845,2021-05-16 22:07:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you struggling in life, with things spiralling out of control? A struggle is an act of worship. The Almighty loves those who surrender completely to Him. There’s wisdom in your trials &amp; tribulations. Don’t scoff at them. Learn from them. Use them to draw closer to Him!"
846,2021-05-16 17:03:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty has made you wait for a long while, be prepared for His abundant blessings. When He finally opens that door meant for you, no one can shut it. That’s a fact. Don’t even try! Your job is to walk  through it with utmost confidence, not arrogance."
847,2021-05-16 04:03:58+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty has made you wait for a long while, be prepared for His abundant blessings. When He finally opens that door meant for you, no one can shut it. That’s a fact. Don’t even try! Your job is to walk  through it with utmost confidence, not arrogance!"
848,2021-05-15 16:01:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful of the company you keep. When you surround yourself with people who constantly blame others, criticize, gossip, backbite and complain about everything &amp; everyone, you’re slowly poisoning your mind &amp; your life with their fears, doubts, and negativity. Break the cycle!"
849,2021-05-15 04:39:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you have a positive outlook, doesn’t mean your world is full of pots of gold at the end of the rainbow, where you ignore life’s challenging tests. Not at all. It means that you respond to difficult situations in a more constructive rather than destructive manner."
850,2021-05-14 21:22:48+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re feeling low, understand this. Such is life with its constant ups and downs. Highs and lows. Everything is in a state of flux. Nothing lasts so don’t allow yourself to overly grieve or rejoice too much. Exercise moderation in what you do. Protect yourself at all costs!"
851,2021-05-14 00:59:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. It’s been a difficult period for all. Even as we celebrate #Eid our hearts are breaking seeing the oppression going on. But in all this we lay our complete trust in You. Protect those most at risk, the elderly, women &amp; children. Comfort those who have lost loved ones."

854,2021-05-13 18:28:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Although we have heavy hearts thinking of our brothers and sisters in #Palestine, celebrating Eid does not prevent us from supplicating and supporting the oppressed in any way we can. May it be a means of elevation for them."
855,2021-05-13 18:28:14+00:00,muftimenk,"#EidMubarak

859,2021-05-12 00:26:12+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Our final moments of this blessed month have been marred by what’s going on in #Palestine and #Gaza. We pray for their safety. May peace and calm be restored. May You alleviate their suffering and all those going through similar scenarios the world over. Aameen .
860,2021-05-11 12:37:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Always ask the Almighty to grant us peace of mind. Don't let the noise around us distract us to the point where we can't figure out what He is doing for us. Instead of focusing on our problems, let us focus on His Plan for us. We need to bear patience &amp; walk in obedience."
861,2021-05-10 23:15:03+00:00,muftimenk,Never curse the experience you’ve encountered in your life journey. Each one was absolutely necessary in order to get you to the next level. Embrace it and use it positively; share it with others so they can learn from your experience as well.
862,2021-05-10 15:18:52+00:00,muftimenk,Heart breaking news on   #AlAqsaUnderAttack. May the Almighty safeguard the people of Palestine and the sacred Mosque. Keep them in your prayers in these last blessed nights #Ramadan . May justice and peace reign. Aameen
863,2021-05-10 11:04:13+00:00,muftimenk,Just because you’ve had a bad week doesn’t mean you’re doomed for life! Get a perspective on things. Do not let such setbacks define who you are. Remember the Almighty has promised ease after hardship. Live your life the best way you can and leave the rest fo the Almighty!
864,2021-05-09 22:16:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Among the traits the Almighty has warned us to stay away from: arrogance and pride. Don’t be deceived into believing that arrogance is wisdom. Far from it! The wiser you are the more humble you should be. Remember, it is not all about you. Always consider those around you!"
865,2021-05-09 05:48:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Be consistent in your acts of worship. Small, daily doses are better than one huge chunk and then nothing at all. The Almighty loves those deeds that are done consistently. Remember, baby steps and build it up progressively. That way, you’re more likely to have staying power."
866,2021-05-08 11:28:59+00:00,muftimenk,Anything that removes you from your comfort zone is uncomfortable. Growth is like that because you’ve never been there before &amp;  you’re getting adjusted to a new you. You’ve never seen this version of you. But growth is the only way forward. So be kind to yourself; seek His Help!
867,2021-05-07 23:34:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep your thoughts pure. Stop undermining whatever good the Almighty has sent your way by letting negative thoughts in. Keep a lid on such thoughts. Speak &amp; think whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely &amp; commendable. Stay positive and your life will be transformed!"
868,2021-05-07 15:12:28+00:00,muftimenk,Keep going even when you find the road ahead long &amp; challenging. Keep going when you feel it’s a bad day &amp; you want to give up. Keep going when you feel your patience running out. Keep going because the Almighty knows your struggles. If only you knew the rewards waiting for you.
869,2021-05-07 04:04:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep us from being distracted as there’s so much going on around us. It’s easy to focus on failure, frustration and fatigue. But we mustn’t. Instead, help us to take it one step at a time because we know You’re in full control. May we surrender to Your Decree. Aameen."
870,2021-05-06 22:28:26+00:00,muftimenk,"With only a week left in the blessed month, #Ramadan it’s common to start feeling a bit worn out by this time. One important tip to renew our motivation to help us end strong is to always remember the Hereafter &amp; the rewards that await us! It will be worth every bit. Keep going!"
871,2021-05-06 09:34:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Let go of the past that’s weighing you down. Otherwise, you’ll find it difficult to realize your goals. It’s foolish to live your life brooding over what was and what could have been. Learn from the past, and don’t repeat the same foolishness. Let it all go so you can grow!"
872,2021-05-06 00:18:00+00:00,muftimenk,"You don’t need people’s approval to be happy. If they have issues with you, it’s for them to resolve; not you. Just be sure you haven’t hurt anyone. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Let it go &amp; don’t let bad feelings fester. Seek your approval only from the Almighty."
873,2021-05-05 15:34:42+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t mock or look down on someone who’s trying to change for the better. Not everyone is on the same level of piety. Their baby steps might be so beloved by the Almighty that it could be their ticket to Paradise! It’s best to focus on ourselves and not what others are doing.
874,2021-05-05 00:02:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Give it your all these last days and do unselfish &amp; random acts of kindness. Whenever you see an opportunity to do good, just do it. Amidst all the problems the world faces today, sometimes it’s that one noble act that reminds us there's still some good around us! Go on &amp; do it!"
875,2021-05-04 14:19:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you the impatient type? Be careful. Impatience can be dangerous. Instead of trusting the Almighty’s timing, you think you know better? Get out of this mindset. Lay your trust in what He’s doing. He’s the best planner right down to the last second.  Never doubt that."
876,2021-05-04 07:57:00+00:00,muftimenk,"This is a fact. You’ll be attacked for doing something good by people who are doing absolutely nothing. They will just sit there and criticize your every move. Don’t worry about such people. Smile, shake it off, take it in your stride and say a prayer for them!"
877,2021-05-03 21:09:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Supplicate &amp; supplicate. Do it with utmost fervour during these blessed nights. May the One who created you bless you, protect you, heal you, forgive you,  promote you, comfort you &amp; ease all your affairs. He doesn’t need perfect words from you. Just a heartfelt call. Sincerely!"
878,2021-05-03 06:51:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop sharing your pain with everyone &amp; never on social media. There are many who would be happy to see you in pain. Be mindful who you allow into your circle. Not everyone is there for your healing. Some will even pray against you. Take your pain to the Almighty, your Healer!"
879,2021-05-02 15:38:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us the strength to face these most blessed nights of #Ramadan. We ask You to accept all our prayers, fasts, charity &amp; good deeds, done solely for Your Sake. May we end this blessed month on a high note! Aameen"
880,2021-05-02 07:39:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is short. So don’t waste your energies on things &amp; people who don't contribute to your growth &amp; are busy with negativity. Wake daily recharged, eager to put to good use the blessings the Almighty has sent your way. Not everyone has this opportunity. Be grateful!"
881,2021-05-01 22:58:31+00:00,muftimenk,"These last ten nights of #Ramadan are the most blessed. Don't do anything to compromise its sanctity. Don't argue, swear, backbite or gossip. Focus solely on the Almighty. Do more good deeds, give generously; make an intent that every little bit you do is for Him and Him alone!"
882,2021-05-01 16:13:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Always keep in mind that on Judgement Day, the Almighty will weigh your deeds &amp; not count them. Quality over quantity. He looks at how much heart was in what was done. Who went out of their way to do it solely for the Almighty and who did it to show off?"
883,2021-04-30 23:47:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Your heart can’t bear the pain &amp; anguish anymore. You’re not alone. You feel distressed. You’re not alone. You need to be patient with what the Almighty has planned for you. For how long, you ask? He will decide on the best time! The more patient you are, the greater your reward!"
884,2021-04-30 11:33:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you worried about “what they will think?” Do they butter your bread &amp; pay your bills? Let them think what they will, you can’t control their thought process. The sooner you realize that, the more positive your outlook will be. Do things for the Almighty’s sake, not for others"
885,2021-04-30 01:57:26+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to help us realise our #Ramadan goal in getting closer to You. Soften the hearts of those who’ve yet to feel the sweetness of this blessed month; don’t let them give in to despair. Give them the strength to keep trying. We ask for Your Mercy &amp; Forgiveness.
886,2021-04-29 22:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t get complacent with your blessings. The more grateful you are, the more the Almighty will send your way. The way forward is to keep nurturing what you already have. Learn to appreciate His Gifts. To be grateful is to find blessings in everything. A powerful attitude!"
887,2021-04-29 12:31:28+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re feeling down and depressed at the moment, you have to believe that you’ll experience the favours of the Almighty in unexpected and unusual ways. For as long as you trust Him, He will turn your troubles, challenges and hardship in your favour. Bear patience!"
888,2021-04-29 03:03:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Never forget who’s in control of every aspect of your existence. So don’t let your grief consume you. Try to step away from your broken state, even if just for a moment. You’ll see things clearer; realise that you own nothing at all. Everything’s on loan from the Almighty!"
889,2021-04-28 18:56:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Strengthen your link with your Maker. Don’t lose heart. Each day we’re being challenged from the outside and inside. But stay firm because for all your worldly troubles, eternal bliss awaits you. Focus on the task at hand and know that it’s temporary. Stay motivated!"
890,2021-04-28 12:05:42+00:00,muftimenk,"What a judgemental society we live in! People will form their own conclusions of you based on a tweet or a Facebook status.  They judge your appearance, accent, the way you dress etc. Just because you’re different from them, they look down on you. Stand your ground. Be polite!"
891,2021-04-27 23:57:34+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how much good you do or how much others value you, there will always be that one person who doesn’t like you. So be it. Such is life. Remember, you’re not everyone’s cup of tea and that’s ok. The sooner you accept it, the easier it becomes to move on with your life."
892,2021-04-27 04:32:30+00:00,muftimenk,Disappointment mostly comes about because of your expectations; not because of other people’s behavior. Accept the fact that people will let you down. Time &amp; again. They’ll show you their true colours eventually. Learn to expect only from the One who made you. He always delivers!
893,2021-04-26 19:52:30+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty will never ignore your pleas. He will never leave you empty-handed. He will replace everything you’ve lost. He will give you something even better when you leave whatever He has prohibited &amp; disallowed.  That’s how merciful He is &amp; He always wants the best for us!
894,2021-04-26 11:46:00+00:00,muftimenk,"We're almost at the halfway mark in #Ramadan.  For those striving hard, keep going. For the rest, it's never too late. The most crucial thing is to finish strong as we enter the last ten nights. The Almighty knows &amp; sees all our efforts, no matter how small. So give it your all!"
895,2021-04-26 02:29:52+00:00,muftimenk,"If you take care of your relationship with the Almighty, He will care of you in ways you never imagined. So nurture the relationship and build that bond. He will grant you the strength you need. He is always building you up even when it seems like He’s breaking you. Trust Him."
896,2021-04-25 19:38:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t wait to turn back to the Almighty. Do it in these blessed days of #Ramadan. The sooner, the better. Seek Him. Thank Him &amp; you’re on the road to a better life. It’s a misconception to wait for things to be prefect before you pray. Things will never be perfect. Start now!"
897,2021-04-25 12:03:25+00:00,muftimenk,"When you do things the Almighty’s way, you’re a winner. Every time. It may not be apparent immediately but it will surely show up eventually. Satan will always intervene. Be sure to protect yourself against His whisperings. Be strong. Remain steadfast and don’t cave in!"
898,2021-04-25 00:12:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t block your blessings by being bitter about someone else’s. Keep gratitude alive in your heart. After all, the Almighty has given you more than what you’ve asked for; with more on the way. Recognize that because He can take it away anytime. Being grateful will increase it!"
899,2021-04-24 07:43:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Life can be short and unpredictable. You need to come to terms with this and when you finally do, you’d give up a lot of the unnecessary stress that you cause for yourself. It also becomes easier to give up all the drama, let go of grudges and value what you have in your life!"
900,2021-04-23 20:46:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Never say you've nothing to offer someone who's down &amp; needs help. A listening ear, a word of encouragement, kindness or even a smile can lift the person out of his doldrums. Be generous with whatever the Almighty has given you because it will all come back to you one day!"
901,2021-04-23 07:09:55+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to forgive all our sins. You know how much we have transgressed and the countless sins we have committed. Do not take us to account for our lack of attention. Do not punish us for messing up repeatedly. Continue to be patient with us. Have mercy on us! Aameen
902,2021-04-22 22:37:34+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of social media, everyone wants overnight fame and instant gratification. Nobody wants to do the hard work. The truth is hard work is the prerequisite. Else nothing is achieved. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. We need to face the brokenness in order to shine."
903,2021-04-22 14:24:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Never tear someone down to build yourself up. You may enjoy momentary bliss but that’s all; it won’t last! We may not realize but we tear others down by laughing at them &amp; the things they do, especially when they make mistakes. Stop this! The tables can &amp; will turn. Wait for it!"
904,2021-04-22 03:17:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop comparing your marriage to what you see online. Couples post pictures making it look like they’re having a perpetual honeymoon and you fall for it. You get miserable. Wake up. Real life isn’t like that. Besides, envy is dangerous. Disastrous even; so get offline &amp; on track."
905,2021-04-21 17:51:57+00:00,muftimenk,Upholding the ties of kinship is important &amp; severing them is a sin. Use this blessed month to mend  whatever is cracked or broken. Don’t wait. You’re missing out on a lot of blessings if you let bad feelings fester between family and relatives. Go on; make the first move!
906,2021-04-21 08:08:04+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re on the verge of giving up because you can’t stand the pain. You’re wondering if the Almighty is aware of what you’re going through. Never doubt He’s All-Knowing, All-Seeing. Remember, you might be experiencing tremendous pain but the result will be beautiful! Trust Him!"
907,2021-04-20 18:53:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Count your blessings instead of your problems. Do that often; you’ll emerge the winner. You’ll find pathways charted for you. The Almighty will grant you strength in times of need, peace in chaos, joy in sadness and hope in hopelessness. The Lord of the Worlds won’t disappoint!"
908,2021-04-20 10:46:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you want to do, do it soonest possible. Don’t wait for the perfect time, the perfect moment, the perfect day. It doesn’t exist. Perfection is not for this world. So before you end up miserable because you’ve been stuck waiting, act on it. Let the Almighty be your Guide."
909,2021-04-20 04:08:18+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is people will talk about you and there’s not much you can do about it. Don’t throw yourself into emotional turmoil when you hear what they’re saying. Remember, the problem is theirs, not yours. If you feel the need to defend yourself against a lie, do it calmly!"
910,2021-04-19 19:48:25+00:00,muftimenk,Plug in with the Almighty wholeheartedly. Do it consciously. Don’t let worldly affairs get in the way. Cut off all the distractions in your path. Those who try to lead you astray. Those who waste your time. Let them all go. Life’s too short to be engaging in futile activities.
911,2021-04-19 06:30:15+00:00,muftimenk,"If their success intimidates or upsets you, then you have a problem. You’re not fully focused on your own journey. You’re also letting ego get in the way. Learn to disengage from what others are doing or not doing. Pay no attention to their harsh words too. Mind your own journey."
912,2021-04-18 22:13:33+00:00,muftimenk,#Ramadan is a very blessed month. Don’t waste it. Give it your all. Losing out would be foolish as you may not see the next one. Let us strive to make this the best month. The Almighty has promised forgiveness &amp; huge rewards if you fast solely for His sake. Paradise awaits you.
913,2021-04-18 11:46:10+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t ignore what you think are the small things in life. They could be the ones that bring you the greatest benefit. Don’t take things for granted. The Almighty puts everything in your life for a reason; to fulfill a purpose. Read the signs. Often you’re too busy to see them.
914,2021-04-18 04:04:52+00:00,muftimenk,"You don’t need the solution to everything. Some questions don’t need answers &amp; they’re better left that way. You just need a firm heart, full of trust and firm belief. A heart full of love &amp; peace. You’ll be amazed at how much more you can get out of the unspoken than just words!"
915,2021-04-17 22:29:57+00:00,muftimenk,You’re feeling ill at ease because you think your life is lacking what you see others have on social media. Don’t fall for this. Understand that not every voice you hear and every post you see on social media is for you. Learn to be discerning. Protect your clarity of mind!
916,2021-04-17 14:08:19+00:00,muftimenk,Looking at the positives when calamity strikes is not for the faint-hearted. You need to have a solid link with your Maker. You understand that difficult times help move you forward. Struggle and strife are standard life lessons. Embrace them and see things in perspective!
917,2021-04-16 23:09:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Every chapter in your life serves a purpose. Yes, even the ‘bad’ ones. The Almighty never wastes anything that He puts you through. So whenever you feel hopeless or alone, close your eyes; remember that He’s with you. He will never abandon you. Trust that better days are coming!"
918,2021-04-16 08:42:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through, don’t quit. Carry on with the journey knowing that something better awaits you. Because He has promised ease after hardship. That should be a good enough reason. When you get through it, you’re going to be stronger, wiser and more resilient!"
919,2021-04-16 03:28:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep us far away from obscene speech, ignorant acts, argument and insults, not just because we’re fasting but because they incur Your Wrath. Such actions are often intended to offend, intimidate, cause emotional upheaval etc. Let’s clean up our acts. #Ramadan"
920,2021-04-15 13:11:14+00:00,muftimenk,We are not perfect. We are a work in progress. We will continue to make mistakes. But that’s part of the process. Don’t start doubting yourself and your ability. Be kinder to yourself. Allow yourself some leeway. Be guided by the Almighty always and have a blessed journey!
921,2021-04-15 06:22:55+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty makes us wait, there’s wisdom in it. Don’t think it’s a punishment. It could be a protection or perhaps, preparation. Always think good thoughts because He always wants the best for us. It may not be what we envisaged but it’s what we need at that point in time!"
922,2021-04-14 21:13:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be so easily deceived by this worldly life. It’s full of trickery. It will sap your energy &amp; leave you totally exhausted. If &amp; when you eventually get what you want, you’d have to forgo some aspects of your life. Keep your faith intact! That is non-negotiable at all times!"
923,2021-04-14 17:01:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus on yourself. Mind your own business. Don’t start comparing and spoil every blessing you have. Remember, your grass will never get greener by focusing on someone else's lawn. Water your own. Nurture your own. Refocus your energy on your blessings. You’ll reach your goals!"
924,2021-04-14 03:26:03+00:00,muftimenk,Let #Ramadan calm you and soothe you. Your soul needs it. Let it cleanse you and purify you and remind you of the countless blessings the Almighty has sent your way. Let your heart be filled with gratitude. Let it soften even more as you do what it takes to get closer to Him!
925,2021-04-13 22:20:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you consider yourself strong? Are you among those who make time to help others, even when you’re struggling with your own issues? Life is about service to others. We’re often preoccupied with our own selfish needs. Start reaching out to others &amp; see how life is transformed!"

927,2021-04-13 14:32:02+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Keep our hearts humble as we begin this blessed month #Ramadan. We seek Your Mercy and Forgiveness and may You keep us steadfast. We beg you to open spiritual doorways for us and answer our prayers. May we use this time to purify our hearts and gain closeness to You.
928,2021-04-13 03:29:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Many have started  #Ramadan today, the rest tomorrow. I wish each and every one of you the most blessed and spiritually uplifting month amidst the difficulties we are all facing. May the Almighty keep us steadfast and make us better people, reaching out to those in need."
929,2021-04-12 16:56:16+00:00,muftimenk,"It is normal to start and end Ramadan a day apart in different regions based on the sighting of the moon, timezone and other rulings. #Ramadan has been announced in Saudi Arabia and many countries. Southern Africa has NOT yet sighted the #moon.

#RamadanMubarak  to one and all."
930,2021-04-12 03:29:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because someone is intimidated by your light, doesn’t mean you shine less bright or dim it! In fact, it means you should shine even brighter; especially in an increasingly dark world. There are those who need that light &amp; goodness. You’ll never know whose life you’ll touch!"
931,2021-04-11 15:37:53+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t fret over failure. It happens to the best of us. It’s no big deal if you fall down; just don’t stay there. Get back up &amp; get moving again. Sometimes you may get knocked down lower than you’ve ever been. Make sure you stand back up taller than you ever were. Don’t cave in!
932,2021-04-11 08:08:15+00:00,muftimenk,"The irony of it all. Death is chasing us just like we’re chasing this temporary world! Today, many souls left us; the same will happen tomorrow. The truth is we're clueless when our time will come. Let us be prepared &amp; always be in a state of obedience to our Lord! Turn to Him!"
933,2021-04-10 20:54:12+00:00,muftimenk,"When you lay your trust in the Almighty &amp; let Him guide you, have faith in the journey. Satan will cast doubts &amp; aspersions along the way.

934,2021-04-10 04:58:57+00:00,muftimenk,Why is it that many can’t stand it when someone is doing well? They will try to plant seeds of doubt in people’s minds. They may even spread falsehoods just to hijack the success story. Let them plot &amp; plan. The Almighty’s fully aware &amp;  in control. Trust Him to pave the journey.
935,2021-04-09 20:28:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Do good solely for the sake of the Almighty. He loves those who do good. Whatever others are doing to you, reciprocate with kindness &amp; goodness. Relieve others from their worries, even if they don't help you. Make this your life mantra &amp; watch how peaceful your life becomes!"
936,2021-04-09 11:45:22+00:00,muftimenk,Keep supplicating to the Almighty. It’s one of the best cures for diseases of the heart. Communicate with your heart &amp; soul. Get close to Him. He will comfort you. Don’t search for happiness in a place where you will not find it. Know that true happiness comes from Him alone!
937,2021-04-09 06:15:56+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant us a #Ramadan like we’ve always known. Here we are on the cusp of the most awaited month. Allow us to reach it in the best of faith and health. Grant us a great and blessed month. Shower us with Your forgiveness. May You accept our sincere repentance and prayers!
938,2021-04-08 17:31:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you’re on a bad chapter in your life right now, doesn’t mean it will stay like that  forever. Ease will come. Good and better chapters await you. Believe it! Trust the journey. Nothing you battle is ever wasted. It's all going to work for your good. Be encouraged!"
939,2021-04-08 09:40:44+00:00,muftimenk,"In a world obsessed with physical beauty, remember it’s the purity of the soul that matters. People with such souls are more elegant and beautiful than those adorned with the finest designer wear and jewellery. Cherish such people because they’re the true expression of beauty."
940,2021-04-08 04:02:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to be more grateful. Focus on what you have, your blessings, the people you love, the opportunities you’ve been given etc. The Almighty loves those who are grateful. He rewards them in unimaginable ways. You could be one of them. Make gratitude a way of life. Embody it!"
941,2021-04-07 18:49:39+00:00,muftimenk,Go on and inspire others. Give people some hope. Give them a reason to believe in better and that all is not lost. You have no idea how powerful and far-reaching this could be. Spread goodness and positivity and you’ll see the difference it makes to those around you!
942,2021-04-07 08:15:54+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have a strong connection with your Maker, you’ll be warned when something doesn’t feel right. The world calls it intuition or gut feel. The truth is it’s the Almighty giving you an inkling of what lies ahead. Pay close attention because it could save you from a calamity."
943,2021-04-06 15:40:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Cultivate the habit of saying less. Why do we feel the need to explain or justify everything that we do to others? There’s no need for this. Many of us have been brought up that way. Break free from this norm. Not everyone needs to know everything. Remember, less is always more!"
944,2021-04-06 04:30:09+00:00,muftimenk,Pray for others. Don’t just pray for yourself. Many are hurting in silence. Sadly our society encourages us to make others feel like everything is always okay. Surely you should be allowed to say otherwise and that you need help. Don’t forget a smile can be a sign of silent pain!
945,2021-04-05 20:31:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The thing about life is, it carries on, with or without you. Be prepared for whatever comes your way. When you least expect it, it will test you &amp; challenge you. How you respond will set the tone for the rest of your life. Don’t take things for granted. Be on guard always!"
946,2021-04-05 08:32:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t make people a priority. You’ll be disappointed. Yes, do your best &amp; cultivate good relationships but don’t hinge your hopes on them. They’re human &amp; they have weaknesses. Put the Almighty at the top of the list always. He will give you insight &amp; wisdom in your journey!"
947,2021-04-04 22:20:11+00:00,muftimenk,"It gets harder to stay focused when your trials get more challenging. Some may even become disillusioned. But always believe that despite the twists and turns in your life, the Almighty’s totally in control. The truth is that’s what faith is all about!"
948,2021-04-04 14:33:55+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have to lie about someone, you have a diseased heart. You may get temporary euphoria but it won’t last. It’s a sign of their success and your failure. Sooner or later, it will all come back to you. Don’t rob others of what is theirs. Fear the Almighty. He is All-Seeing."
949,2021-04-04 05:03:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Start &amp; end your day with the Almighty. You’re better off that way. Everything else in between will fall into place. With Him in your life, all things are possible. Make it a daily commitment to include Him in all that you do! You’ll have less stress, feel better &amp; worry less!"
950,2021-04-03 22:43:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind to yourself. The Almighty never asked you to burden yourself. Be realistic. Don’t think good deeds must be huge or not at all. No! He loves small, consistent deeds. No flash in the pan acts. Don’t sabotage yourself by limiting it to big, showy deeds done once in a while!"
951,2021-04-03 05:52:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Never feel bad about saying no to the wrong things. Habits, people, activities. They can come in many forms. Seek your strength from the Almighty. He will pave the way for you to say yes to the right things. He will send profound blessings into your life. Watch it unfold!"
952,2021-04-02 17:02:41+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste time. Quit trying to change your hater’s mind. Quit arguing with those whose sole intent is to tear you down. Quit debating with those who don’t really matter. Let them get on with their life and you carry on with your purpose. Let the Almighty handle the rest.
953,2021-04-02 05:24:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t wait for perfect circumstances. They don’t exist in this world. Do your best today. Don’t wish it away by waiting for better days to come. Trust the Almighty to give you what’s best.  Remember, He will always provide. Keep obeying Him and your blessings will follow!"
954,2021-04-01 22:47:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Our world is broken and hurting. Too much is going on which we can’t comprehend. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Help us to rest in the fact that You are in full control. Help those who are struggling in one way or another, amid the confusion. Guide &amp; protect us always!"
955,2021-04-01 16:00:36+00:00,muftimenk,Being positive is a mindset. It means you choose to respond in a manner that’s optimistic &amp; constructive. You remember that the outcome could have been worse. It doesn’t mean you’re in denial that life is a bed of roses. Far from it. It means you’re grateful for what life offers.

957,2021-04-01 04:04:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of destructive criticism. When people are envious of you, don't let their cheap shots bother you. They will make slanderous statements, spreading insults, half truths and lies. It says more about them than you. Focus on those who are sincere and work on your shortcomings."
958,2021-03-31 21:36:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus your mind on the Almighty, under all circumstances. If not, you’ll get distracted by the worldly stuff. Many things can sabotage your attention; your problems, your insecurities etc and they will cloud your mind and judgement. So always rely on Him. Not your own strength."
959,2021-03-31 07:00:35+00:00,muftimenk,"See everyday as a new chapter in your life. The past is over so don’t live there. Stagnation is dangerous. Honestly, you don’t want to be stuck there. Move along with firm belief that the Almighty has planned well for you and your loved ones. Go on. Write that next chapter!"
960,2021-03-30 20:32:21+00:00,muftimenk,"In every chaotic moment you’re experiencing, there’s always a choice. Peace or worry? The choice is yours. If you believe that the Almighty is in control, then why worry? Choose peace because you know deep down in your heart that the Lord of the Worlds will grant the best outcome"
961,2021-03-30 09:54:01+00:00,muftimenk,"You may not be happy now. You may be questioning why things didn’t happen the way you had planned. But trust me, one day, you'll look back and be so pleased  that things didn't work out the way you thought you wanted. That’s because the Almighty always knows best!"
962,2021-03-29 21:16:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Be genuine when correcting people’s mistakes.  Do it discreetly, in the most subtle way. It shouldn’t make them feel embarrassed or unintelligent. No need to mock or humiliate. Instead soften their hearts with kind words so they feel your sincerity. Be empathetic always."
963,2021-03-29 13:03:43+00:00,muftimenk,"You know yourself best in most cases. But the minute someone says something about you, you crumble. You start doubting yourself, you start questioning things. Don’t. This person hasn’t walked in your shoes. You should only be worrying about how the Almighty perceives you!"
964,2021-03-29 05:22:10+00:00,muftimenk,Train your mind to let beautiful thoughts in and keep the negative ones out. Don’t even entertain those thoughts which will not benefit you. Let positive thoughts come out of your mind and watch things unfold right before your eyes. See how much progress you’ll make all round!
965,2021-03-28 19:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s get this right. The Almighty is never too busy to listen. He’s always there for us. But we are constantly distracted &amp; unfocused with worldly stuff. That’s the reality. Don't be too busy to talk to Him. And don’t do it only in times of need, forgetting Him in times of ease!"
966,2021-03-28 12:52:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Our journey can be painful, but it’s our experience that can mould us into compassionate, kinder &amp; wiser humans. When we go through loss, failure, pain &amp; suffering, there’s always an opportunity to realign ourselves get closer to the Almighty. Don’t waste it!"
967,2021-03-28 06:03:24+00:00,muftimenk,Watch your words and actions. It’s so easy to tear people down if you aren’t careful. Your goal should be to build people up. Put their insecurities to rest. Remind them they are worthy. Say a good word. Smile. Be their beacon of light in a world that’s often dim and muted!
968,2021-03-27 14:22:42+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re going through some difficult times all by yourself, don’t despair. The Almighty has designed it that way to allow you to embrace your solitude. There is much to learn and grow from it. Keep going. Don’t give up. He’s watching over you as He always does. Have faith!"
969,2021-03-27 06:20:25+00:00,muftimenk,"One of your biggest tests will be how you handle people who treat you badly. Do you let your heart be forgiving, challenge their evil with good or do you let revenge and hatred brew in your heart? Remember, the Almighty sends everyone to us as a test. So did you pass the test?"
970,2021-03-26 17:39:59+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful of the company you choose. True friends aren’t the ones who help you have fun without a care in the world and make you obsessed with material trappings. True friends are those who stand by your side and they’re concerned with helping your faith grow stronger.
971,2021-03-26 03:45:10+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Humble us to respond with goodness when we’re not being treated the way we should be. Help us to be guided by what You’ve taught us &amp; not by our emotions when dealing with difficult people. May we always be steered to make the right choice in such situations! Aameen.
972,2021-03-25 05:34:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Not all feedback deserves your attention. Some are constructive and good for you. Some are toxic and can have a negative effect on your well-being, both emotional and mental. Learn to be discerning. Remember, it’s always important to protect your mental and emotional well being."
973,2021-03-24 18:28:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Life can be challenging. Trial after trial. I don't have all of the answers, but I know that You do. Almighty, I have full faith in You and know that You always have my back. You’re my Provider, Cherisher, Sustainer, Protector and everything I need! Keep me firm in faith."
974,2021-03-24 07:51:50+00:00,muftimenk,Mend relationships &amp; ties. Reach out to those you’ve wronged. Be magnanimous &amp; extend that to those who’ve wronged you as well. You’ll feel peace in your heart. The burden will lighten &amp; you can heave a sigh of relief. Trust the Almighty to send untold blessings into your life!
975,2021-03-23 23:07:40+00:00,muftimenk,Understand that nothing is random in life. The Almighty will place people and situations in your path. They’re meant to test you until you become the person you’re meant to be. So don’t ask why me? Because each one will be tested differently according to his level of faith!
976,2021-03-23 15:53:13+00:00,muftimenk,Stay away from conflict. Choose peace. It’s a better way to go. Choose silence or choose to walk away from those who are always looking for a battle about someone or something. Don’t bother getting drawn into situations that will drain you both mentally and physically!
977,2021-03-23 08:33:39+00:00,muftimenk,"When you embrace change, some won’t be happy. They prefer the “old” you. The one they’re comfortable with. Don’t worry about what they say. Carry on doing what must be done. It’s your journey. If you’re living your life to please the Almighty, you’ve  nothing to worry about!"
978,2021-03-22 20:30:33+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes it can be extremely exhausting explaining yourself to people who have made up their minds to misunderstand you anyway. They’re not interested in what you have to say; only in their own agenda. Being silent is perhaps a good option. Let your work speak for itself!
979,2021-03-22 04:12:49+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be disappointed if your deeds go unappreciated &amp;  unrewarded in this world. Don’t worry. It’s the nature of man to forget. Constantly remind yourself that people will forget &amp; overlook. The Almighty doesn’t. He will reward you for all that you’ve done &amp; your patience!
980,2021-03-21 12:58:50+00:00,muftimenk,Social Media has given everyone a voice. Friend &amp; foe. Good &amp; bad. Intelligent &amp; ignorant. Pious &amp; evil. Sincere &amp; hypocritical. Genuine &amp; fake. Righteous &amp; sinful. Innocent &amp; criminal. Be careful who you believe &amp; what you believe. It will transform you into whatever you choose!
981,2021-03-21 10:53:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Let things be and let them unfold naturally. Sometimes it’s best to do that. You don’t need the answers to everything, you don’t have to be right always, don’t expect people to understand you. Just be polite but firm. Work on yourself and keep your inner peace at all times!"
982,2021-03-20 20:35:09+00:00,muftimenk,"The sooner you realize that you cannot control other people, the easier your life becomes. You can’t force them to do what they don’t want to do. The only person you can control is you. So don’t let their behavior upset you. Take it in perspective. Don’t get hurt!"
983,2021-03-20 10:38:14+00:00,muftimenk,Take your time to heal from whatever it is that has hurt you or caused you grief. It won’t happen overnight. It’s a process which requires a lot of patience. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Let Him be your Guide and  Protector because only He can make you whole again.
984,2021-03-19 19:43:30+00:00,muftimenk,"What you are experiencing right now cannot defeat you unless you allow it to. Have a positive mindset. Rise above life’s challenges, knowing they won’t last. Learn as much as you can. Remember, the Almighty has helped you through many trials. He will continue to do so. Trust Him!"
985,2021-03-19 12:46:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be so hard on yourself  for making a genuine mistake. Remember, the Almighty had already planned it that way for you to learn from what went wrong. The lesson was necessary. It’s part of His Plan for you. Embrace it and try your best to not  make the same mistake again."
986,2021-03-19 04:43:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant me the wisdom to do what’s right. When I’m stuck in my own foolishness, show me the way out. When I’m facing loss &amp; grief, comfort me. When my heart is broken, hurt &amp; wounded, show me healing. When I’m confused &amp; overwhelmed, guide me! I lay my trust in You."
987,2021-03-18 04:59:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Do yourself a favour. Surround yourself with those who speak of visions, ideas, goals, growth. Not those who sit and gossip about others. And if you do find yourself in that situation, excuse yourself and walk away. The game ends when you choose to leave such a gathering."
988,2021-03-17 15:20:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t hold back your charity waiting for an appropriate time. There’s no such thing. The minute you feel like giving, just give. There’s no guarantee where you’ll be tomorrow. The Almighty will reward you for your gesture now and grant you even more in the blessed month to come!"
989,2021-03-17 05:07:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let anyone belittle your efforts. You’re doing just fine. Keep up the good work! Keep on putting one foot in front of the other, taking one step at a time, even if they’re baby steps. No rushing and plunging headlong into things. Keep moving at a sure and steady pace!"
990,2021-03-16 22:47:14+00:00,muftimenk,"How do you live your life? If you live your life for others, you’ll never know peace as nothing you do will be good enough. If you live your life making decisions based on what others will think of you, it’s time for a rethink! Live your life for the Almighty. Feel the peace!"
991,2021-03-16 05:10:48+00:00,muftimenk,Gratitude is a choice. So choose wisely. Surely there are so many things we can be grateful for in this life. We can never really count the blessings the Almighty has sent our way. So stop complaining and feeling miserable. Rise above it and see life through a different lens.
992,2021-03-15 21:37:43+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty wants you to try. Try to make an effort to get closer to Him. Try to stay focused and not be distracted. Try to not get angry, overreact and overthink. Try to be the best version of yourself. Try to do as He says. Try to understand His Plan for you. Keep trying!"
993,2021-03-15 10:57:37+00:00,muftimenk,"We're all blessed in different ways. Often we don't realise that we have much more than others. Peace, contentment, faith, family &amp; health are some of the greatest blessings. If you have those, you're truly blessed. Don't allow anything to make you feel otherwise. Stay blessed!"
994,2021-03-15 04:37:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose prayer over worry always. Worry changes nothing but prayer changes everything. If you’re stuck in worry mode, you’ll end up with more worries. It never ends. One worry leads to another. Quit worrying and start praying. Trust the Almighty with the outcome."
995,2021-03-14 21:09:57+00:00,muftimenk,Listen and observe carefully. That way you’ll have a better idea before letting people into your life. People actually show their true colours long before we actually bother to acknowledge it. So do  yourselves a favour. It can save you from a lot of heartache down the road!
996,2021-03-14 11:01:42+00:00,muftimenk,"You need to quit worrying about what people think. Honestly, it doesn’t matter. They’re entitled to their thoughts. At the end of your life, you're not going to stand before people and give an account of what you’ve done. You're going to stand before the Almighty."
997,2021-03-13 22:29:47+00:00,muftimenk,"When you ask the Almighty, ask with conviction. Believe in what you pray for wholeheartedly. Keep repeating it in the best way, showing no impatience on your part. Whatever He gives, whenever He gives is the best thing for you. He’s the Best Planner and He knows the best timing!"
998,2021-03-13 12:34:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't judge a person based on just one particular clip you saw of them. It’s unfair. It could be fake, edited or taken totally out of context. Be mindful. The damage we’re doing to ourselves and others by such opinions can have disastrous effects on us in this world and the next."
999,2021-03-13 07:33:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Make peace with those you’ve wronged. Don’t hold grudges. This life is too short. You never know when it’s time to leave this earth. So while the opportunity is there, don’t hesitate. Satan will make you procrastinate, thinking you have time to do it tomorrow. No. Do it today!"
1000,2021-03-12 19:15:37+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll be tested again &amp; again. When faced with challenges, don’t focus on the problems. Remember His Promise; with hardship comes ease. If you focus on the problem, you’ll be overwhelmed &amp; feel you probably won’t make it. So remind yourself what the Lord of the Worlds can do!"
1001,2021-03-11 23:11:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Prayer:
Almighty. At times, I feel I can’t carry on; it’s hard to keep going with such anxious thoughts running through my mind. Grant me peace and a calm heart. Let me surrender my worries, fears and anxieties to you. Grant me guidance and keep me going. Remind me I’m not alone!"
1002,2021-03-11 21:54:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep praying for guidance. This life is often tough. May its challenges not overwhelm us. Satan is always there to distract and discourage. Know his tricks and don’t fall for them. Seek the Almighty’s help throughout life’s journey. Remember, He is with us in all circumstances!"
1003,2021-03-11 13:12:18+00:00,muftimenk,Are you facing tough times? One of the best remedies is to be patient. The trouble is we often start complaining. We become short-tempered. We talk about our difficulties to anyone and everyone. Seek the Almighty’s help instead. He’s the Owner of all solutions to our problems!
1004,2021-03-10 22:16:33+00:00,muftimenk,You’re never meant to carry your burdens alone. The Almighty is always watching over you. He will fight your battles and see you through. Do your best and lay full trust in Him. Don’t feel bad about it. Hand Him your burdens and He will give you the peace you're searching for!
1005,2021-03-10 04:53:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re tempted to overthink, pray. In fact, pray before you do anything. Prayer can change your destiny. Whenever you feel unloved, unimportant or insecure, remember who created you! Pray to Him alone. If you only knew how powerful prayer is, you  wouldn’t stop praying!"
1006,2021-03-09 21:15:39+00:00,muftimenk,Be careful how you treat people. The tables always turn. The Almighty will see to it. Be careful who you ignore when you’re at the top. Some choose to treat people any which way that pleases them. Don’t! It will come back to you. You’ll be made to eat humble pie sooner or later!
1007,2021-03-09 13:46:47+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have decided to forgive someone who wronged you, just move on. You should feel a sense of peace with your decision. There’s no need to rekindle the friendship etc. The onus is not on you. Live and let live."
1008,2021-03-08 20:30:11+00:00,muftimenk,The mistakes you make can actually be a turning point. The Almighty can turn the mistake into a huge blessing. It’s up to you to see it or are you too busy wallowing in self-pity?  Don’t beat yourself up for the wrongs you commit. Use them to propel you to the next level!
1009,2021-03-08 13:13:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Disappointment is part of life. You can’t always get what you want. If it doesn’t happen now, it doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Trust the Almighty to work out the timing. On your part, be consistent, persistent and determined. You’ll get there!"
1010,2021-03-08 04:16:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let other people dictate how you behave. Your gentleness is a gift. Your kindness, a strength. Your selflessness in extending help is a spark the world  badly needs now. Just do your thing. Don’t let anyone stop you or extinguish the light in you. People will talk anyway!"
1011,2021-03-07 22:29:55+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes you may have to remove yourself from certain people in your life; those who won’t bat an eyelid about hurting you and continue to do so. It won’t be easy but you have to make a decision. It will bring you peace of mind and heal your soul!
1012,2021-03-07 15:42:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Be conscious what you feed your mind. A toxic mind is a toxic life. Start healing your soul and you’ll heal your life. That’s when you can truly become the best version of yourself. It won’t happen overnight but if you persevere, you’ll get there with the Almighty’s help!"
1013,2021-03-07 07:43:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of the company you keep. When you are with the wrong crowd, they see you as competition. They look at you with the eyes of envy. Some even speak ill behind your back and hope for your failure. Learn to observe people’s behaviour. The Almighty often sends warning signs!"
1014,2021-03-06 18:08:22+00:00,muftimenk,Some people are negative about others because they need to make themselves feel like they’re in control to cover up their own insecurities. Take heart knowing that it’s not about you but them. This could help you detach from their comments &amp; not to feel hurt by what’s being said!
1015,2021-03-06 04:14:20+00:00,muftimenk,Are you prone to worrying? Worry is a disease. It will eat you slowly and destroy your focus. It will gnaw at your faith and ultimately make you miserable and kill your joy. Don’t fall victim to this.  Don’t allow your future to be sabotaged by worry. Seek the Almighty’s help.
1016,2021-03-05 18:41:33+00:00,muftimenk,Apologise. Admit your mistake &amp; take full responsibility. It shows our human weakness. You’ll gain a lot more respect that way rather than trying to push the blame to someone else. It’s this self-awareness that allows us to grow and learn from our mistakes &amp; forgive ourselves!
1017,2021-03-05 05:04:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Forgive the glance of our eyes, the foul language of our words, the forgetfulness of our minds &amp; the slip of our tongues. Protect us from shame &amp; failure, from Your punishment, anger, wrath &amp; Hellfire. Grant us Your Mercy &amp; the best of both worlds. Aameen!"
1018,2021-03-04 21:57:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind to everyone. Life can be hard &amp; lonely. So if you’re able to spread some goodness &amp; positivity, do it without hesitation. Make people feel better. Make everything a little brighter. Surely that’s a good thing to do if the Almighty has given you the capacity!"
1019,2021-03-04 04:22:39+00:00,muftimenk,You didn’t experience whatever you've been through in the past for nothing. Every bit of it was the Almighty’s Plan. The Almighty is going to take you to a another level. He has it all planned for you. Turn to Him. Bear beautiful patience and wait for things to unfold!
1020,2021-03-03 22:42:19+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes you won’t understand what’s going on. That’s when you need to trust the Almighty even more. Just leave it to Him in complete obedience. Take comfort knowing that He will work all things out together for our own good. He will turn things around when you least expect it.
1021,2021-03-03 09:36:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Change is the only constant. Don’t fight it. Don’t wait till you have no choice. Make changes on your terms. That way, you’ll always be prepared. Start with small steps so it’s less likely to affect or hurt you as much. Let the Almighty be your guide!"
1022,2021-03-02 22:32:15+00:00,muftimenk,You may feel that things are working against you &amp; you’re despondent. This is the work of Satan. Get hold of yourself. The Almighty wants only what’s good for you. You may feel like there’s no way out. But He always has a way out. Perhaps not today or tomorrow. Be patient!
1023,2021-03-02 14:37:59+00:00,muftimenk,"When your turn finally comes, you’ll see why the delay was inevitable; why you had to wait. Remember, you can’t grow into a butterfly overnight, there is a process attached to it. Embrace every part of it because the process teaches us some valuable life lessons!"
1024,2021-03-01 22:14:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Never forget that with the Lord of the Worlds, nothing is impossible. Change your mindset. Be optimistic and confident when you ask Him for what you want. Stop being pessimistic and think the worst will happen. Don’t pay lip service and say you trust Him. Put it into practice!"
1025,2021-03-01 09:59:10+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s a silver lining to everything! Nothing that the Almighty sends your way is bad. Sometimes being let down by someone can be the direct cause for you to dig deep in yourself, finding your own strength. You learn you depend only on the One who made you. No one else matters!"
1026,2021-02-28 21:55:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Pray for others. Use that power to help other people reach their destiny. It’s good to pray for others. It’s good to lift and build people up. There’s so much negativity around, that it’s good to encourage and be a positive  voice for a change!"
1027,2021-02-28 12:34:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Understand this. If you’re going to please the Almighty, you won’t always please people. He is at the top of your list. Don’t you ever forget that. Never leave Him out of the equation in all your affairs. Anyway, you’ll never be able to please people. So don’t waste time trying!"
1028,2021-02-28 00:36:16+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have nothing good to say, remain silent. Each time you open your mouth to speak, you’re letting others know the state of your mind &amp; what’s in your heart. If your heart is filled with bitterness, it will come out in your words. Be mindful of what’s going on inside you!"
1029,2021-02-27 08:51:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Faith is beautiful. You don't have to see the whole path ahead of you in order to walk it. Take your time in your journey. Appreciate all that the Almighty has sent you. Keep moving even if it’s baby steps. Most importantly, be consistent. You will get there eventually!"
1030,2021-02-26 17:08:59+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful of toxic people. They love playing victim. They’re also good at manipulating others into believing that you're the bad guy. Don’t worry if you’ve been blamed for something you didn’t do. That’s life really. What’s important is The Almighty is All-Knowing! He’s aware!
1031,2021-02-26 08:16:16+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant us light when our world is enveloped  in darkness. Grant us hope when despair fills our souls. Strengthen our faith when doubts threaten to shake our belief. Be our Guide when we lose our way. Keep us under Your Protection as we go through the trials of life.
1032,2021-02-25 19:59:36+00:00,muftimenk,Do you feel stuck in a rut? Do this as often as you need to. Reset. Restart. Keep doing it till you achieve your focus again. It’s easy to lose perspective and get distracted with all that’s happening around us. Keep your intentions sincere.  Seek help from the One who made you!
1033,2021-02-25 07:41:26+00:00,muftimenk,Your faith will be tested when you’re facing a dead end. Believe that the Almighty can &amp; will provide alternative solutions to your problem. Understand His Plan. Keep a look out for new opportunities. Often we are so hung up on the closed doors that we fail to see what’s there!
1034,2021-02-24 23:14:11+00:00,muftimenk,"We don’t have much time left so don’t waste it. Be picky how you spend your time. Be mindful who you invest your time in. Remember, wasted time is worse than wasted money. You can recover money but once gone, that time is lost forever."
1035,2021-02-24 13:58:12+00:00,muftimenk,"When you finally come to terms that everything is from the Almighty, you’ll achieve an immense sense of peace &amp; calm in your heart. You won’t be rattled by the outside forces. You believe that whatever comes, let it come, whatever goes, let it go &amp; whatever stays, let it stay!"
1036,2021-02-24 06:17:44+00:00,muftimenk,You don’t have to discredit someone to feel good about yourself. Be the one who fixes something that’s not right in others without telling the whole world about it. Do things quietly away from the limelight. Let your heart smile at your deed! And the Almighty knows!
1037,2021-02-24 00:53:39+00:00,muftimenk,Nothing is a coincidence. You have to surrender &amp; trust the Almighty in all your affairs. He doesn't just tell us to do something; He guides us through it. It includes getting us to be in the right place at the right time &amp; putting different people in our lives. That’s His Plan!
1038,2021-02-23 11:40:07+00:00,muftimenk,Be kind always. Nobody knows what problems people may be battling. Just because we don't talk about them doesn't mean they're not there. We all deal with things differently. Some find it easy to talk and open up about what they’re going through. Others don't. Show compassion!
1039,2021-02-22 22:16:07+00:00,muftimenk,Are you the vengeful type? Carrying a heart filled with envy &amp; jealousy. Such traits won’t get you far. You’ll end up miserable &amp; disillusioned with life. Be happy for others. Congratulate their success &amp; send out lots of positive energy! It will all come back to you one day!
1040,2021-02-22 05:24:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about what people say or what they think. In the end, it’s the results that speak. Keep pushing ahead &amp; do your best. When you mess up, you don’t run from the Almighty. You run to Him! He will never forsake you. Even when everyone has deserted you, He’s still there!!"
1041,2021-02-21 20:15:41+00:00,muftimenk,"People will fail you, people will hurt you. That’s part and parcel of this life. The wound may not be your fault. But the healing is your responsibility. Never wallow in self-pity. Seek the Almighty’s help. Get up again and take control of your life. Don’t delay the healing!"
1042,2021-02-21 07:34:45+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re stressed because you’re facing the unknown, the unseen and the unexpected. Remind yourself that the Almighty is able and capable of bringing you through all that and more. Nothing is impossible. Trust Him with everything. Let Him be your defender. You’ll be unstoppable!"
1043,2021-02-20 23:00:46+00:00,muftimenk,Never stop believing that good things can still happen even in times of chaos. That’s how merciful the Almighty is; He can give when you least expect it. He can open doors you never ever knocked and the list is endless. Always think good thoughts of Him!
1044,2021-02-20 10:41:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Things will turn out the way the Almighty wants them to; not the way you always think they should. Trust Him without a doubt. Satan will always mess with your mind, he never takes a vacation. So stay vigilant and stay connected always to the One who made you."
1045,2021-02-19 23:05:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let your past hold you back from your future. No matter how bad you think you are, repent and move on. The Almighty is always waiting to guide you to the straight path. Make peace with Him. Get into His good books. Don’t delay. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone."
1046,2021-02-19 08:08:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Forgive us for the times we forget to thank You for the countless blessings You’ve bestowed on us. Our hearts are filled with gratitude. Life can get hard &amp; we struggle to keep our heads above water. Help us to choose trust, hope &amp; patience when we don’t see a way out."
1047,2021-02-18 21:20:36+00:00,muftimenk,Are you tired of holding on? Do you keep wondering if the Almighty hears your pleas? Don’t let such thoughts cloud your mind. It’s the work of Satan. Ask your Maker to strengthen you. Ask Him to renew your hope. Ask Him to send you signs that things will get better! Just ask Him!
1048,2021-02-18 09:01:19+00:00,muftimenk,"These are no ordinary times. We are living in a period when we must have firm, unflinching faith that the Almighty is our Refuge and shelter. So much is happening at breakneck speed that it’s easy to lose focus. Don’t despair. Stop stressing. He knows what He’s doing! Trust Him!"
1049,2021-02-17 23:55:35+00:00,muftimenk,"In all circumstances, pray. Never give up on the Lord of the Worlds. He’s All-Seeing, All-Knowing. Even when your lips no longer know what to ask for in prayer, He will listen to your heart. Where He is concerned, everything speaks volumes, including your tears. Keep the faith!"
1050,2021-02-17 14:50:27+00:00,muftimenk,"How short and fragile is this life! Keep reminding yourself especially with all that’s going around today. Take nothing and no one for granted. Appreciate everything, do your best under any given situation. Don’t give up and keep going. Most importantly, keep peace in your soul!"
1051,2021-02-17 07:15:59+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful of this. Sometimes even those with good intentions can lead you down the wrong path. Tread carefully. Watch where you’re heading. Learn to listen to the Almighty more than you listen to people. Trust Him more than you trust people. People are fallible. He isn’t!
1052,2021-02-16 12:41:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Master this and you’ll live a life of contentment. Wait patiently for your turn. It will come... sooner or later. Until then, keep applauding for others. Don’t begrudge their blessings. Life is really that simple!"
1053,2021-02-16 03:53:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Never underestimate the immense power of a heartfelt prayer. It soothes your soul. Quit stressing. Just pray. If you use it as a means of comfort, the Almighty will provide you with peace of mind. We need that now more than ever before. And remember prayer changes everything!"
1054,2021-02-15 23:16:41+00:00,muftimenk,Is the Almighty at the top of your list when you need help? Don’t ask Him for help only as the last resort. He expects us to make an effort to solve our problems but He doesn’t want us to do it alone. He’s always there for us. He waits for us to reach out.  Call out to Him!
1055,2021-02-15 15:49:19+00:00,muftimenk,Stay true to yourself. The Almighty made you unique. Don’t blend in with the crowd just to fit in. Don’t do things just to appease people because you’ll never be able to please them. They’ll make you feel small so they can look big. Stay encouraged. Keep spreading kindness!
1056,2021-02-15 04:33:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Your toughest lessons can lead to your biggest blessings. They also teach you a lot about life &amp; make you see reality. Remember, the bed of roses you’re used to is NOT real life! But more importantly, the challenges will make you stronger than you ever imagined yourself to be!"
1057,2021-02-14 14:39:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you fell off, doesn't mean you have to stay there. Get up and get moving. Change will be messy in most cases. The transition from the old you to the new you will be a struggle. It’s a battle with the new habits you’re trying to introduce in your life. Keep going!"
1058,2021-02-14 00:15:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Many things aren’t always what they seem. Often we take situations at face value. We don’t recognize that they are not what they appear. Be thorough, don’t take someone’s word for it. Keep your eyes open &amp; find out for yourself."
1059,2021-02-13 10:32:20+00:00,muftimenk,Stop stressing over the fact that you haven’t figured it all out yet. No one has! Trust that the Almighty has your back and He will work it out. Your job is to do your best. He will test your faith. He will test your patience. He will test your sincerity. Don’t rush things!
1060,2021-02-12 22:01:04+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re in financial quandary, don’t be ashamed to downgrade your lifestyle. Many have lost their jobs in this pandemic. So be realistic. Be practical. You’ll adjust and find your equilibrium. Don’t live on a strained budget. You’ll emerge the winner eventually."
1061,2021-02-12 13:59:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you get offended when someone corrects you? If you do, you’ll never really grow in life. But keep the correction constructive and respectful, never offensive. Remember, you can never stop taking correction and learning. The day you stop is the day you leave this earth!"
1062,2021-02-12 00:24:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep hope alive in our hearts. We may not see a way out of our predicament but we know that You have a way. You always do in Your own time. Fill our hearts with deep rooted trust in You. Despite the setbacks we have to deal with, You will never disappoint! Aameen."
1063,2021-02-11 12:36:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Perhaps you’re so kind because the world has been unkind to you &amp; you don’t want others to experience what you went through. Remember, never let others dull your shine. Be an excellent example to others. Never mind if they don’t deserve it. The Almighty loves doers of good!"
1064,2021-02-11 11:34:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Today we've lost one of the elders of the Muslim Community of Zimbabwe. Al Haji Mahomed Mussa was a legend. A well known businessman &amp; philanthropist. May Allah Almighty forgive his shortcomings and grant him Paradise. Aameen
https://t.co/hGsvc4taz7"
1065,2021-02-10 20:03:07+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t rush the Almighty. Let Him do what needs to be done. Don’t block your blessings by moving too quickly. Sometimes the wait might be long. But nothing goes unanswered! Trust His timing. Bear beautiful patience while you wait. Great things take time!
1066,2021-02-10 06:30:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Caring for yourself is not selfish. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Distancing yourself from those who drain your energy, those who constantly want to argue and criticise etc is self-preservation. Sometimes you just have to do it for your own sanity and to keep the peace."
1067,2021-02-09 23:05:49+00:00,muftimenk,"The bigger the battle, the bigger the blessings! Not everyone understands this. Some think that once you turn to the Almighty, life will be smooth sailing. It won’t. But what it does is you’ll be able to put your trust in Him, whatever the situation. He’s watching your response!"
1068,2021-02-09 09:20:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Fix this immediately. When something isn’t right &amp; you feel yourself drifting away from the Almighty, get to the root of the problem. What took you away &amp; distracted you from Him? Don’t delay dealing with it because Satan can cause untold damage to your faith. Remain steadfast!"
1069,2021-02-08 21:08:32+00:00,muftimenk,This is how merciful our Lord is; He will open doors we didn’t even knock on! So why do we get upset when He closes certain doors in our lives? He knows things which you and I don’t. He only wants what’s good for us. Always.
1070,2021-02-08 13:54:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people don’t realise what they have until it’s gone. Sadly, they’ll only realise it when it’s too late. That’s why gratitude is important. Value what you have. Recognise your blessings. Sometimes the Almighty might take it away from you completely and you won’t get it back!"
1071,2021-02-07 23:30:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, talk is cheap. Anyone can say anything and promise you the world. Don’t fall for it. Beware those who will sell you a dream but you’ll end up with a nightmare. Protect your heart &amp; guard it well. Do not give it to just anyone. Keep it connected to the One who made you."
1072,2021-02-07 13:32:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Life isn’t easy. Don’t expect a smooth ride. There will be road blocks. There will be diversions. There will be detours. But these are not dead ends. The roads ahead may be unfamiliar, unchartered territory but the Almighty has said He won’t test you beyond your capacity."
1073,2021-02-06 19:03:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep your problems in perspective. No matter how bad you think your life is, your problems are always small when you think of what others are facing. Cancer, sudden death, losing a loved one, the list goes on. Even on a bad day, you have to realize how fortunate you really are!"
1074,2021-02-06 08:38:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn this. Not every comment deserves a response. Some people pass snide remarks just to see how you’d respond. Don’t say a word. Better still, ignore it. Remember, you don’t have to react to everything. Keep your focus, stay grounded. Let the naysayers have their say."
1075,2021-02-05 20:39:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, no one owes you anything. Your responsibilities are yours alone. Don’t expect anything from anyone. That way, you won’t be disappointed or begrudge anyone. Free your heart from ill feelings towards others. Depend only on the Almighty. Indeed, He is  sufficient for us!"
1076,2021-02-05 15:04:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Exactly ten years ago I joined Twitter!

I chose to be focused, dedicated, consistent, empathetic and respectful towards all.

Do you think I've done that?"
1077,2021-02-05 03:50:56+00:00,muftimenk,Are you in pain? Do you feel lost? Are you in a dark place with no light at the end of the tunnel? Do you feel hopeless? Turn all that around by turning back to the Almighty who will set things right for you. Do it today with the firm belief that things will get better.
1078,2021-02-04 22:18:55+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Calm our anxious hearts as we face life’s trials. Times are tough. There are things happening which we don’t understand. Anxiety threatens to darken our path. We ask You for the strength to carry on. Grant us peace amid the troubles and keep our hearts close to You!
1079,2021-02-04 14:02:42+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all been stabbed in the back, lied to, treated poorly; the list goes on. But don’t dwell on the negatives because at the end of the day, realise that no one but the Almighty is going to be there for you. So the less you depend on people, the less disappointed you become!"
1080,2021-02-04 06:00:45+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as you want to resolve matters and get to the bottom of things, some things are better left the way they are. Let the Almighty take care of it. He knows how to handle it best; He knows how it will pan out. He has all the solutions to what you’re facing right now!"
1081,2021-02-03 09:35:16+00:00,muftimenk,Life is too short. Live it with passion and purpose. Don’t let anger control you. Don’t let hate breed in your heart. Don’t let negativity be the order of your day. Keep your heart guided in the right direction. Seek the Almighty’s help constantly to purify your heart!
1082,2021-02-02 23:11:45+00:00,muftimenk,"If you disagree, it doesn’t mean you have to be disrespectful. Disagreement is acceptable. Being disrespectful is not! When you disagree, there’s still room for various viewpoints. But once you become disrespectful, you’re bulldozing your idea and shooting down everyone else’s."
1083,2021-02-02 04:03:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you finding it hard to move ahead in your journey? Quit overthinking, quit replaying failed scenarios, quit negative thinking and start seeing the good and positive side to things. It’s amazing what a change in mindset can do for you. Try it and you won’t look back."
1084,2021-02-01 15:03:55+00:00,muftimenk,Let’s face it. It’s a fact that we won’t like everyone who comes into our lives. That’s okay because we’re humans. So let people go gracefully. Don’t be petty and don’t say nasty things about them. Be mature about it. Take it in good spirit. We all have our likes and dislikes!
1085,2021-02-01 08:08:39+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t jump into things too quickly. Always assess and reassess any given situation. Know when to get involved and when to lay off. Some things just aren’t worth your time and energy. There’s too much going on around us and it’s easy to get sucked into other people’s drama.
1086,2021-02-01 00:12:19+00:00,muftimenk,"There are some who will misunderstand you no matter what you say or do. They’re just not meant to be on your journey. Remember, you’re fulfilling your purpose, not theirs. So it calls for a different path.  Don’t worry. The Almighty will send people who should be in your life!"
1087,2021-01-31 19:55:53+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want the Almighty to answer your prayers, then keep making them with the same fervour and passion you did at the start. Don’t let a delay in getting what you want dampen your spirit. He will never turn you away empty handed. You have to believe that wholeheartedly!"
1088,2021-01-30 19:44:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Be grateful for every new day that the Almighty gives you. Embrace every moment of it while preparing for the next. Don’t miss out because once gone, the moment doesn’t come again. Stop being anxious. Everything is in His Hands. Do your best and just live."
1089,2021-01-30 10:55:27+00:00,muftimenk,The material things in your life don’t matter. That’s right. Your value as a person does not come from them. You always have something to offer the world &amp; you don’t need anyone else’s validation to know this. So don’t compare yourself to your friends. Appreciate your blessings!
1090,2021-01-29 22:44:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful how you treat people. The Almighty is close to the broken hearted &amp; those who are crushed in spirit. Remember, if you can’t help, don’t hurt. That’s a general rule to live by. Too many are heedless &amp; couldn’t care less when it comes to their interaction with others."
1091,2021-01-29 14:13:09+00:00,muftimenk,Man is always looking for excuses. We say we lack time. But how do we  allocate our time? We have a problem with people. But are we associating with the wrong type of people? We curse our life at times &amp; hate what we’re going through. The problem is we waste the life we’re given.
1092,2021-01-29 02:59:06+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us cope with grief &amp; loss in these uncertain times. Many have lost loved ones in this pandemic. Many are heartbroken that they were apart from loved ones in the final moments. Grant ease &amp; comfort and fill our hearts with patience &amp; hope! Keep us safe from harm.
1093,2021-01-28 16:48:51+00:00,muftimenk,"The problem with many is they tend to focus on how big the problem is instead of trusting the Lord of the Worlds, where nothing is impossible. Ask Him for guidance and He will direct your steps. He knows what you need. So keep walking in faith and obedience. Don’t stop praying!"
1094,2021-01-28 03:38:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re not sure of what you’ve heard about someone, don’t comment or make any disparaging remarks. You never know when you might be in that position. Surely you wouldn’t like it if someone said horrible things about you. Always make excuses for others till the truth is out!"
1095,2021-01-27 15:23:53+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty has blocked something, leave it. Don’t try to revive it. How would you know He’s blocked it? Read the signs. No matter what you do, it’s not yielding any positive results. This is part of His Plan. If you resist it, it will only give you anxiety and frustration."
1096,2021-01-27 09:05:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Saddened by the death of my good friend Ansif Ashraf who passed away this morning in the UAE. May Allah Almighty forgive his shortcomings and grant him Paradise. May Allah Almighty make it easy for his family. Aameen
#ansifashraf https://t.co/vO9BvzT2L0"
1097,2021-01-26 23:33:13+00:00,muftimenk,There will be times when the Almighty holds you back temporarily until the path is clear for you to move on. He can see things we can’t! So be thankful for the delay. Don’t curse it. The Owner of Time knows when it’s best for you to carry on with your journey!
1098,2021-01-26 12:52:16+00:00,muftimenk,"When the hearts are sick, when the hearts are corrupt, even the best deeds count for nothing. So the heart plays a major role &amp; deserves great attention. Seek the Almighty’s help often to rid the heart of major diseases - hatred, envy, malice etc. Keep purifying your intention."
1099,2021-01-26 03:40:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Worry about your own sins, your shortcomings &amp; transgressions. If you do that faithfully, you’ll have no time to worry about what others are up to. Remember, the Almighty is going to ask you about you! He won’t ask you about anyone else. Focus on self. Be the best version of you!"
1100,2021-01-25 14:06:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay humble at all times. Pray for humility. Ask the Almighty to constantly remind you of your faults &amp; flaws, so you don’t act like you’re more superior than the next person. Ask Him to forgive you for the unkind &amp; harsh words you used on others thinking you have the upper hand."
1101,2021-01-25 03:39:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Make a conscious effort to talk about your blessings more than you talk about your burdens and hardship. The problem with us is we let our burdens overwhelm us, forgetting the One who is in control of every aspect of our existence. Remember, the ungrateful are never successful!"
1102,2021-01-24 20:46:07+00:00,muftimenk,There's nothing random about your life &amp; where you are right now. Every step has been carefully planned by the Lord of the Worlds. This is where you need to be. This is where He wants you to be at this stage in your journey. Learn the lessons. They’re your greatest blessings!
1103,2021-01-24 11:30:53+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s nothing wrong in planning your day meticulously but always remember in the end,  it’s the Almighty who decides how that day goes. But as long as you intended well you shall have the reward even if you never got to do it. Actions are always judged by their intentions!"
1104,2021-01-24 03:43:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s face it. We don’t like delays. In fact, we hate it. We want things to happen when we want them. But the truth is, behind every delay, there's a blessing. Remember, the Almighty knows what we don’t. There’s always some hidden good why certain things happen the way they do."
1105,2021-01-23 22:22:51+00:00,muftimenk,"All that you’re going through; your pain, your struggles will always lead to strength. Yes. Without a doubt. They aren’t random events but carefully planned by the Almighty. The Best Planner. They have a purpose. They will lift you, strengthen you and mould you. Embrace them."
1106,2021-01-23 07:32:05+00:00,muftimenk,"You won’t feel at ease if your heart’s not in the right place. Keep purifying your intention In everything that you do. In this age of social media, it’s easy to get carried away &amp; thrive on exaggerated needs for acceptance &amp; validation. Check &amp; protect your heart at all times."
1107,2021-01-22 10:40:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Be on guard always. Bolt the door to temptation and don’t let Satan’s arrows get through. Occupy your thoughts with the remembrance of the Almighty, positivity and good words that can inspire. Keep busy with beneficial things and don’t leave your mind idle! Stay vigilant!"
1108,2021-01-22 00:15:39+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We pray for healing in many areas in our lives. We know You can heal us in a heartbeat. Forgive us for trying to fix our situations all on our own when true help &amp; healing must be found first in You. Forgive us for forgetting how much we need You above all else. Aameen.
1109,2021-01-21 14:08:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel broken, 
When you’re in a dark place with no glimmer of hope, 
When your world seems to be crumbling, crashing down on you; 
Always remember the Almighty will never abandon you. That one sincere prayer can change your entire life. Where there’s hope, there’s life."
1110,2021-01-20 17:43:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Every now and then, pause. Take stock of your life. Are you pleased with your progress? Which areas need improvement? It’s a blessing to be able to stop, recharge and gain strength before moving forward. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad!"
1111,2021-01-20 00:31:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, people can’t destroy what they don’t know. Stop giving them the ammunition. Stop telling them too much. Stop telling them more than they need to know. People are curious by nature. So be careful what you share, especially on social media! Be safe not sorry!"
1112,2021-01-19 06:27:34+00:00,muftimenk,"There will be times when things don’t work out because that’s not where the Almighty wants you to be. Don’t question Him. Instead, trust Him, His plan &amp; His timing. Even when you don’t understand the details of His plan, bear patience because it will be unravelled in good time!"
1113,2021-01-18 19:11:03+00:00,muftimenk,Cut out distractions from your life. It’s a tall order because we’re surrounded by all sorts of things daily. Focus on how much you’ve been blessed with and how much the Almighty has favored you. Give up ingratitude or you’ll end up missing out on the good happening around you!
1114,2021-01-18 06:38:07+00:00,muftimenk,There are some who will scrutinize your life not because they like you or are admiring you. They can’t believe that you’re doing so well despite all the hate &amp; venom they have thrown in your direction. Take heart. Don’t stress over it. The Almighty knows &amp; sees all the goings-on!
1115,2021-01-17 23:10:33+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t ruin the happiness of others. Your turn will come. Be careful how you react when the Almighty blesses your neighbour. Be happy for him and pray that the Almighty rewards you in a similar manner. Don’t go around spreading rumours or gossiping about him. Check your heart!
1116,2021-01-17 04:51:53+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, you’ve just got to let things go for your sanity and peace of mind. Don’t ask any questions or look for any answers. Don’t expect people to understand you. Don’t expect anything from anyone but the One who made you. You’ll have fewer disappointments that way."
1117,2021-01-16 13:35:10+00:00,muftimenk,"When you see a bend in the road, it’s not the end of the road. Take the leap of faith and make that turn. That’s life in essence. You have to keep going. No stopping. No quitting. You only win if you don’t quit. So don’t ever give up on yourself!"
1118,2021-01-16 03:09:54+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t keep bitterness in your heart. It will gnaw at your heart and wear you down. Let go of such feelings and move on. It’s easier said than done but you’ll be thankful you did. Because unforgiveness left in your heart will destroy you more than the person who hurt you!
1119,2021-01-15 10:03:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Amid the crisis in the world right now, grant us peace of mind &amp; relieve the anxiety &amp; stress we’re experiencing daily. Give us clarity of mind to do what’s best. Guide us through the path of life which is often paved with many obstacles. Let peace reign in our hearts!"
1120,2021-01-14 20:59:24+00:00,muftimenk,Do you feel that it seems easier to stay where you are than to follow a better path? Fear will make you feel this way. Your detractors hope you stay this way. But staying put gets you nowhere. Take that leap of faith. Start what you need to do! The Almighty has your back!
1121,2021-01-14 14:28:10+00:00,muftimenk,Leave a trail of goodness wherever you go. Inspire people. Give them hope. Motivate and encourage. Help them believe that better days are ahead. The storm shall pass. Never underestimate the power of positivity. Keep spreading good vibes and continue to make a difference.
1122,2021-01-13 21:42:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Life’s a marathon not a sprint. Keep going. Don’t stress over petty things. Eventually, everything gets better. One day, you’ll realize that you’re no longer bothered by those things that used to upset you &amp; rob you of your inner peace. What matters most is pleasing your Maker!"
1123,2021-01-13 01:48:01+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as we try to protect our hearts, we’re all broken in some ways. Bring your wounded heart to the Almighty. Cry out to Him. Tears are prayers too when you can’t speak. He will restore you. There are many who are suffering from things they can't tell anybody! So talk to Him!"
1124,2021-01-12 12:23:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to overcome your challenges. Don’t run away from pain, fear and brokenness. Face them head on. Make a plan. It won’t be easy. But know that you’re never alone. Call on the Almighty. But whatever happens, be sure not to give up. Persistence is key in overcoming challenges."
1125,2021-01-12 04:05:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop asking people probing personal questions. Why someone is not yet married or not having children is seriously not your business. Such is the struggle many are going through. Be kind. Be compassionate. And if you can’t be those, be quiet."
1126,2021-01-11 22:31:18+00:00,muftimenk,"What goes on around you is not something you can control. But what goes on inside you is something you can control! In fact, you have to control it or it will ruin your peace. You need to be centered, focused &amp; single-minded so you can weather any storm with the Almighty’s help."
1127,2021-01-11 07:07:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Be grateful not just occasionally but daily. Don’t take anything for granted. As much as the Almighty gives, He can also take away. Thank Him for all that you have. Don’t compare your life to others. They may look ‘“perfect” on social media but they all have problems in real life"
1128,2021-01-10 21:51:27+00:00,muftimenk,Keep your heart connected to the Almighty at all times. You’ll reach a stage in your life where you’ll trust Him completely that you don’t get upset anymore when things don’t go your way. You know that the Best Planner will turn every disappointment into a blessing!
1129,2021-01-10 13:20:56+00:00,muftimenk,Stay true to yourself. Do your own thing and don’t worry about what people say. It might not make sense to them but that’s okay. Don’t expect everyone to understand you. They don't have to. It's between you and the Almighty. So keep going!
1130,2021-01-10 04:48:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Never underestimate what the Almighty can do. Just because you can’t do it, doesn’t mean the Almighty can’t do it! He’s the Lord of the Worlds. If He can turn night into day, He can surely change our situation in the blink of an eye. He’ll do it when He knows the time is right!"
1131,2021-01-09 20:13:35+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes you keep facing the same old problems because you keep allowing the same people back into your life again &amp; again. Sometimes the Almighty wants you to put a full stop but you refuse to read the signs. Perhaps it’s time to stop pressing rewind &amp; hit the delete button!
1132,2021-01-09 11:39:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Praying for #SJ182 that took off from #Jakarta, #Indonesia earlier. May the Almighty grant safety to one and all. Aameen
#Boeing737"
1133,2021-01-09 07:29:35+00:00,muftimenk,"When you mess up in life, when you feel yourself down in the dumps, when you think you’ve committed sins so huge that there’s no way out, turn to the Almighty; not turn away from Him. He is the most Merciful and He will guide you back on track if you call on Him sincerely!"
1134,2021-01-08 21:12:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Once you've sinned, acknowledge it, quickly repent &amp; move on. Clear your slate with the Almighty. Don't waste time overthinking &amp; dwelling on it, letting it destroy you &amp; ruining your future. That’s what Satan wants and that’s exactly what he will do! Don't allow him to succeed."
1135,2021-01-08 00:15:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. As the pandemic has forced many into lockdown again, we look to You for comfort, strength &amp; protection. Calm our hearts amidst the turmoil. Help us wait patiently for this to pass, trusting with firm faith. Help us look out for each other &amp; keep us all in your care."
1136,2021-01-07 08:20:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Not everyday will be smooth sailing. It’s okay if today didn’t go your way. It’s not the end of the world. Take it in your stride. If you’re doing your best, that’s good enough! The Almighty is aware &amp; will reward your effort, no matter how insignificant you thought it was!"
1137,2021-01-06 22:52:59+00:00,muftimenk,There will be people who won’t be happy for your success. They don’t want to see you grow and get better. But the truth is no one can stop what the Almighty has planned for you. That’s right! No one! So keep going. Don’t quit on yourself. Trust Him in all that you do.
1138,2021-01-06 15:24:39+00:00,muftimenk,Do yourself a favour. Be yourself and quit trying to be someone else. That’s a sure recipe for disaster. The Almighty has made each one of us unique &amp; there is only one you. Focus on being the best version of yourself. Work hard at it and don’t worry what other people say!
1139,2021-01-05 14:41:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Can you ever accept that you’ve made a mistake or that you were wrong? When you do recognize it, do you still stand your ground? If you do, you probably have toxic traits. You like to pick on people’s faults too. You need to work on yourself &amp; your heart where it all starts!"
1140,2021-01-04 15:36:53+00:00,muftimenk,Pray wholeheartedly. Supplicate wholeheartedly. You can’t have doubts and expect the Almighty to change your circumstances. It doesn’t work that way. So don’t block your prayer and whatever you’re asking Him by being doubtful. Trust Him fully and watch your life unfold!
1141,2021-01-03 21:06:48+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll attract what you are! That’s a fact! Do good &amp; good will come back to you. Be kind &amp; you’ll be offered the same. When you radiate positive energy, you’ll surely attract the likes of positivity. So make a commitment to do good because what you give out is what you get back!"
1142,2021-01-03 13:06:56+00:00,muftimenk,"When you do what’s right, what the Almighty has prescribed for you and leave whatever He has forbidden, it will never be a distraction. It will, in fact, bring you closer to Him. So be mindful of what you’re occupying yourself with because it can mess your link with Him!"
1143,2021-01-02 22:33:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep going. Not all days will be smooth sailing. Some days are tough, really tough and things seem uncertain. But always move ahead with hope. Hope that things will get better because the Almighty has promised us that after hardship, there’ll be ease. So don’t despair!"
1144,2021-01-02 10:33:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Never underestimate what the Almighty can do. He can change things at the drop of a hat. Don’t dwell on what didn’t happen or didn’t work out. Never quit at the slightest setback. Keep moving ahead and the results will follow eventually. Remember, miracles happen everyday!"
1145,2021-01-01 21:07:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful how you treat others. The ones you disrespect, disregard or dishonor may have a high status with the Almighty. You’ll never know! You have no knowledge how He views them so it’s wise to be kind to all you meet. You don’t want to jeopardize your relationship with Him!"
1146,2021-01-01 05:13:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us the courage to begin again wherever we’ve faltered. Despite the obstacles and difficulties in life, help us be patient enough to know that starting over takes time. Grant us strength and guidance in whatever we undertake and always keep us on the straight path."
1147,2020-12-31 13:12:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Step out of your comfort zone &amp; do the things you’ve been putting off for too long. Do those tedious tasks that need to be completed. Don’t procrastinate. Do it today. Nobody’s promised tomorrow. Remember, growth takes place when you are challenged, not when you are comfortable!"
1148,2020-12-30 23:49:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Attitude makes a whole lot of difference. If you are struggling or in pain right now, keep your head up, think positive &amp; keep on smiling, you'll get through this. Don't let anyone or anything bring you down today. You're destined for success. Trust the Almighty &amp; keep going!"
1149,2020-12-30 11:07:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Not everyone has your best interest at heart. Look out for those who aren’t happy for your healing, your growth &amp; your success. At times, the naysayers are those closest to you &amp; the biggest supporters are those furthest from you. Focus on those who matter &amp; nurture those bonds."
1150,2020-12-30 03:37:05+00:00,muftimenk,Stop letting Satan take you for a ride. You should be familiar with his tricks by now. He will bring back old sins which you have repented for and cast doubts in your mind about the Almighty’s Mercy. Stay focused. Don’t fall for this narrative. Move on and look ahead with hope!
1151,2020-12-29 21:24:09+00:00,muftimenk,You’ll start to outgrow a lot of people once you start doing what’s best for you. Stop worrying about how others will feel or whether they’ll accept it.  This life’s too short for that. Be concerned about how things will be before the Almighty on Judgement Day. That’s your goal!
1152,2020-12-29 13:26:47+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t worry about people liking you. You should know by now that they’re a hard lot to please. Nothing is good enough for them. So don’t stress over this. You liking yourself is what matters. That’s your milestone. People liking you is a bonus. Get your priorities right.
1153,2020-12-28 22:22:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful when you speak. Choose your words carefully. Good or bad, words are little seeds that can make a big difference in the present &amp; the future. Use your words to bring life to those around you. Don’t use your words to stab people &amp; leave indelible marks in their hearts."
1154,2020-12-28 06:27:57+00:00,muftimenk,There’ll be times when the Almighty puts you in situations completely out of your control just to remind you who’s in charge. Recognize it. Don’t question Him. He knows what He’s doing. Cultivate a good attitude and have full faith in Him to get you through it.
1155,2020-12-27 23:27:09+00:00,muftimenk,"You will fall. You will make mistakes. But that doesn’t make you worth any less. Get up again. Times are difficult. Many are sick. Others have lost their jobs, etc. But it doesn’t mean the Almighty is unaware. He is always there for you. Call out to Him. He loves it when you do."
1156,2020-12-27 07:20:27+00:00,muftimenk,Does your heart feel heavy? Does your mind see no way out? That’s when you need to trust the Almighty &amp; depend on Him even more. Don’t entertain negative thoughts from Satan. Rise above it. It won’t be easy but you must do it. Bear utmost patience. He will show you a way out.
1157,2020-12-26 23:15:33+00:00,muftimenk,Thank the Almighty for everything you have &amp; every trouble you don’t have because He kept them away from you. Many out there are struggling to survive in this difficult time. You’ll never be able to count all your blessings so the least is to thank Him upon all conditions!
1158,2020-12-26 13:11:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry if you’re not where you want to be. You can’t rush good things. They take time. They have to go through a process. Work hard, do your best. Leave the rest to the Almighty. His timing is best. When you see the results, you’ll be glad you kept going and didn’t give up!"
1159,2020-12-26 06:20:18+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, you’ll meet all sorts of people. Those who frustrate you, anger you, push you to your limits, annoy you etc. It’s part of your test. Take it in your stride. Each one will have a lesson for you; good &amp; bad. This is how you grow! Everyone crosses your path for a reason!"
1160,2020-12-25 17:10:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan never attacks where he has won. He attacks where he knows he’s losing. The closer you are to the Almighty, the harder he has to work. So remain steadfast. Stay strong. You’re winning this. Keep firm faith and remain unflinching in your ways. Don’t let your guard down!"
1161,2020-12-25 05:04:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Make us content with whatever You have decreed for us. Let us go through it, bearing beautiful patience, knowing You’re in full control. Constantly remind us that nothing in this world lasts forever. Guide us to the best of manners, forgive our sins &amp; purify our hearts."
1162,2020-12-24 22:21:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feel bad or guilty about taking care of yourself. It’s not a selfish act. In fact, it’s very important and it will help you live a more positive lifestyle. You have to take care of yourself or you will have nothing left to give others. Remember, you are worth the effort."
1163,2020-12-24 13:27:21+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful of those who are out to make you look like the villain. They never tell the whole story. Just the part that makes you look bad. They have an agenda and will go all out. Stop trying to prove them wrong. Don't partake in their drama. The Almighty will vindicate you.
1164,2020-12-24 06:07:30+00:00,muftimenk,"When you expect very little or nothing at all from people, you won’t be easily disappointed. The more you expect &amp; demand from others, the more disappointed you’ll be. Focus on giving &amp; helping others. It’s a more gratifying experience. The Almighty will reward you immensely!"
1165,2020-12-23 23:18:59+00:00,muftimenk,You should know by now that people come &amp; go from your life. That’s why it’s important to be rooted with the Almighty that nobody's absence or presence can disturb your inner peace. Let them walk in or walk out. It doesn’t matter to you. What matters is your solid link with Him!
1166,2020-12-23 16:06:20+00:00,muftimenk,No one has a perfect life. You don’t need a perfect life to be content or happy. We’re grateful for the Almighty’s blessings and we constantly thank Him for looking after us. Accept change and His trials as part of this short life. Bear patience and never lose hope in His Mercy.
1167,2020-12-23 08:01:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is but test after test. Be prepared to be tested with fear, failure, loss, health, wealth. Bear it with good patience or get upset &amp; miserable? What should keep you going is the thought that nothing lasts. The Almighty has a beautiful Paradise waiting for you. Don’t give up!"
1168,2020-12-22 18:14:17+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, the answer to your prayer is not in what He gives but in what you lose. You may not see it immediately but eventually you’ll realize the loss was the Almighty’s Mercy. He was saving you from calamity. Be forever grateful because you could never have done it on your own!"
1169,2020-12-22 11:26:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t try to live up to other people's expectations. Don’t go through life making decisions based on other people’s desires. Remember, they don’t have to live with the results of those choices. You do! Take control of your life. Do your best and make the Almighty your priority!"
1170,2020-12-22 03:51:07+00:00,muftimenk,"It might not be obvious to you now, but greater things are being planned for you. You're always given the test before the reward. You're always given the struggle before the strength. Hardships always come before the ease. Keep trusting the Almighty. The blessings will follow."
1171,2020-12-21 18:49:09+00:00,muftimenk,The only person you should be competing with is you. The only person you should be outdoing is the person you were yesterday. Focus on yourself &amp; your shortcomings. Aim to be a better person with each new day. Your grass will never be greener by focusing on someone else's lawn.
1172,2020-12-21 08:20:59+00:00,muftimenk,We’ve all made wrong choices in the past. Don’t let regret overwhelm you. Get back on track. Seek the Almighty’s help and believe that He wants the best for you. Believe that He will redeem the past and restore your present. Leave the worst behind and move forward in faith!
1173,2020-12-20 22:24:23+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty forgives but people don't always forgive. Don't allow the harsh words or judgement of man to create a distance between you &amp; the Almighty. You might pay a price for some sins you commit on earth but sincere repentance will ease your path to Paradise. Don't lose hope!
1174,2020-12-20 08:09:50+00:00,muftimenk,Not everything that leaves our lives need to be chased. Let it go. The Almighty has decreed some things for you. Others are not meant for you. You may have encountered them for a brief moment. Perhaps there were lessons meant for you. Don’t dwell on what was. Life’s too short!
1175,2020-12-19 16:00:11+00:00,muftimenk,Be friends with those who are happy when you do well. They cherish your victory &amp; support you. They’re excited when things work out for you. They share your views &amp; goals. Keep such people in your inner circle. Never mind if their number is small. Quality over quantity!
1176,2020-12-19 06:43:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of those who are out to make you look like the villain. They never tell the full story, just the part that makes you look bad. They have an agenda and will go all out. Stop trying to prove them wrong. Don’t partake in their drama. The Almighty will vindicate you!"
1177,2020-12-18 23:56:10+00:00,muftimenk,"People will do all they can to tarnish your image, smear your personality etc but take heart because no matter what they do they can’t take away your good deeds. Let them say what they want. The Almighty knows the truth &amp; those who know you better won’t fall for such cheap shots!"
1178,2020-12-18 16:49:06+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes the Almighty removes a particular person from your life because the relationship no longer serves any purpose. There’s no more positive growth. Learn to recognise it. Don’t run after that person who is not meant to be part of the next journey of your life. Move on!
1179,2020-12-18 08:33:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We’re not perfect. We sin, we falter and make mistakes but we do our best trying to please You. We ask You to accept the deeds we do solely for Your sake. Forgive our shortcomings. We will never lose hope in Your Mercy. We will always keep our hearts attached to You!"
1180,2020-12-17 16:51:11+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty loves you more than you could ever imagine. He will keep testing you but all within limits which you can bear. He will never abandon you. So never give up. Just when you thought you’ve reached the end of your tether, He will show you a way to start over! Keep going!"
1181,2020-12-17 08:52:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful who you trust. Remember, sugar &amp; salt? They look similar. So tread carefully. Listen to your gut feel. The Almighty has given you intuition. Use it wisely. Watch what people are doing. Not just what they’re saying. When words &amp; actions are aligned, trust is affirmed!"
1182,2020-12-16 21:38:44+00:00,muftimenk,Be mindful of Satan’s tricks. He will keep bringing up your past. People &amp; events from what was. He doesn’t want you to change &amp; get closer to the Almighty. Be firm. Stay focused. Remember why you left your past in the first place. Don’t look back. He will work it out for you!
1183,2020-12-16 05:36:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes you may want to address some things badly but you know they’re better left unsaid. Because if you do, you may end up regretting your words &amp; actions. It’s a great challenge to exercise restraint but you must for your own peace of mind. The Almighty will take care of it."
1184,2020-12-15 15:01:18+00:00,muftimenk,Maturity is when you stop complaining &amp; making excuses. Stop blaming others for what’s going on in your life. It’s easy to look for scapegoats. But a mature person realizes that whatever happens is mostly a result of choices you've made. Take control of your life! Be accountable!
1185,2020-12-15 05:40:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Get up every morning with a fresh, new attitude. Remember, no one is promised a new day. So don’t waste the opportunities that the Almighty has laid out for the day. Believe that He wants only good for you. Having a grateful attitude will determine how you live your life."
1186,2020-12-14 13:12:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Jealousy is evil. Don’t let it take root in your heart. It can multiply like cancer cells, jeopardizing your future blessings! The longer you leave it in your heart, the more it spreads &amp; damages you from the inside out. Quit being jealous. Encourage &amp; uplift one another instead!"
1187,2020-12-14 03:40:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remember that we are nothing without the Almighty. But with Him, we can expect great things. He has blessed us with so much. Never forget to count your blessings and be grateful. Gratitude is key. Gratitude brings contentment. Gratitude makes what we have, enough!"
1188,2020-12-13 16:23:47+00:00,muftimenk,Stop telling people more than they need to know. It only provides them with fodder for more gossip. Oversharing is not healthy. It can lead to unnecessary complications in life especially if you shared with the wrong people!
1189,2020-12-13 07:25:08+00:00,muftimenk,Let’s face it. We all tend to worry about the future from time to time. That’s ok. We’re human. But try not to exhaust yourself on something that hasn’t even happened. Don’t clutter your mind with such thoughts. Focus on the present moment. Live positively. Trust the Almighty!
1190,2020-12-12 22:10:27+00:00,muftimenk,"This life is a test. Take it in your stride. Remember, nothing lasts. There’ll be good days and tough days. So don’t let the difficult days destroy you. Similarly, the good days shouldn’t distract you to such an extent that you forget your purpose in this life! Keep it balanced!"
1191,2020-12-12 16:54:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of your words. Always speak the truth. Uncovering a lie can be extremely painful. Once someone lies to you, the trust is broken. Rebuilding trust after that can be extremely challenging. May the Almighty protect us from such acts and keep us trustworthy at all times!"
1192,2020-12-12 03:14:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t use hurtful words on anyone. Don’t mock someone for whatever it is they may be going through. If it’s something you haven’t experienced &amp; endured, you shouldn’t pass judgement. Because when it happens to you, you might become everything you ever criticized in others!"
1193,2020-12-11 17:00:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Be patient with others. Remember, the Almighty is most patient with you. How many times have you faltered; yet He brought you back on track, repeatedly! There will come a point in life when it will just hit you. Indeed, we have a Lord who is Most Merciful!"
1194,2020-12-11 07:18:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. The pressures of life at times push us to a corner, making it hard to move forward. Help us not to quit but to keep going on the straight path faithfully. Give us the strength to overcome each obstacle in our path. We have full faith in You, with Your Mercy and Might!"
1195,2020-12-10 20:31:53+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to set healthy boundaries. Learn when to walk away and when to work things out. You can’t control how people treat you. That’s on them not you but you can control what you tolerate. Be kind but firm. There’s no need to be rude about it. You’ll be thankful you did it!
1196,2020-12-09 22:54:56+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s a teaching moment in every trial that the Almighty sends your way. Each pain makes you stronger; every betrayal makes you wiser, every failure makes you more resilient. He will keep testing us till we learn the intended lesson. Keep learning! Life always has a lesson!"
1197,2020-12-09 12:58:50+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re close to the Almighty, you’ll be extremely grounded. Nothing worldly will shake or affect you that you lose your sense of self. You’ll have inner peace. You won’t be easily provoked. You’re better able to control your anger. You’re calm in the face of adversity!"
1198,2020-12-08 23:06:31+00:00,muftimenk,Wait patiently. It’s never a punishment. It could be a protection. And it’s certainly a preparation for when the door finally opens. It’s all to do with timing. The Lord of the Worlds knows when it’s best to give you what you’ve been asking for day and night!
1199,2020-12-08 14:22:29+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, the Almighty will slow you down just to protect you. A delay doesn’t mean denial. There’s evil ahead of you which you can’t see but He can. So don’t always be in a hurry. Read His signs. You’ll be forever grateful that you didn’t rush headlong into things. Slow down!"
1200,2020-12-07 22:39:07+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to be fair. The Almighty loves those who are just. Sometimes you don’t like someone based on what others have said about him or someone else's description of him. But he turned out to be a good person. So stay away from having preconceived ideas. Give everyone a chance!
1201,2020-12-07 04:28:03+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will give you what you want when the time’s right. If it’s good for you, He’ll make sure that you get it. If it’s bad for you, He will keep it away from you. Never for a moment think that He hasn’t  heard you. He knows what’s in your heart even before you uttered it!"
1202,2020-12-06 12:30:37+00:00,muftimenk,"We often forget who’s in control of our journey. We plan as if everything is guaranteed. As if we’ll get everything we want. But the Almighty has shown us, especially during this pandemic that we should appreciate everything that we have. He can take away anything, anytime!"
1203,2020-12-06 03:35:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to wait patiently. Not with a bad attitude. When you see friends being blessed, be happy for them. Pray for their well-being so the Almighty might grant you the same favours. Your turn will come. Live by this principle: when it wasn’t my turn, I never hated. I just waited!"
1204,2020-12-05 22:39:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Feel hopeless? Feel like the world is caving in on you? Feel like you’re in total darkness with no light at the end of the tunnel? Remember, no matter what you’re going through, that one sincere prayer can change your entire life. Where there’s hope, there’s life. Always!"
1205,2020-12-05 07:15:38+00:00,muftimenk,"The greater the obstacles, the greater the victory. Don’t complain when your test is a difficult one. The Almighty tests those He loves most. He’ll keep testing us. There’s a purpose behind the trial. Tests are a way to purify us. Embrace it. You’ll realize its value eventually!"
1206,2020-12-04 13:42:00+00:00,muftimenk,"How you live your life daily matters. Are you sowing seeds of goodness so you can reap them later or are you doing whatever you feel like. Don’t waste your short time in this world. Sow seeds of positivity, gratitude, love, hope etc and see how it impacts those around you."
1207,2020-12-04 07:11:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Forgive us for trying to fix things on our own. Forgive us for running around seeking help when we should be turning to You. Forgive us for forgetting how much we need You above everyone &amp; everything else. You know our pain, burden &amp; cares. Heal us. Make us whole again!"
1208,2020-12-03 21:48:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s be honest about it. From time to time, we all do foolish things. We make mistakes. As long as we acknowledge our shortcomings and seek forgiveness, nothing we do is beyond the capacity of the Almighty to forgive. Remember, we make mistakes. He doesn’t! He’s perfect!"
1209,2020-12-03 05:55:18+00:00,muftimenk,Do you sometimes feel like the weight of the world is too much on your shoulders? Don’t fret. You’re never alone. Don’t think you’re helpless &amp; there’s no way out. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Feel your load lighten. Know that He will grant you the best outcome!
1210,2020-12-02 21:44:23+00:00,muftimenk,"You may have sins the size of a mountain but once you sincerely repent, the Almighty wipes them all out because He loves repentance. Don’t let Satan make you believe otherwise. Don't let your sins drown you. Repent today and start focussing on blessings, no matter how small."
1211,2020-12-02 06:43:09+00:00,muftimenk,Nothing good comes easy. The process will be painful at times but trust the Almighty to see us through it. Pain is essential for growth; it can move us towards a more deeply fulfilling life. Our greatest growth periods normally come from the experience of pain. Trust the process!

1213,2020-12-01 11:47:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Each time you face hardship, the naysayers &amp; skeptics are waiting on the sidelines. Waiting &amp; anticipating for you to fail. Thus the importance of staying grounded no matter what’s going on. Be firm. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Don’t lose focus when calamity strikes."
1214,2020-11-30 22:55:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Many tend to look back with pain and disappointment for making the wrong choices, decisions etc. That’s life. It’s inevitable. Everything happens for a reason. Learn the lessons from your past and never make the same mistakes again. Move on. The Almighty is there to guide you!"
1215,2020-11-30 07:45:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay away from abusive  language, insults &amp; curses. Many use it without thinking. It’s become a habit for the young, thinking it’s cool to utter such expletives. They’ve become desensitized to the use of foul &amp; offensive words. Don’t fall into the trap. It’s NOT cool! It’s a sin!"
1216,2020-11-29 21:17:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you derive pleasure when misfortune befalls someone else? Are you guilty of this? Something bad happens to someone else and you are secretly gleeful. Be careful. It shows a poisonous heart which willl get worse if you don’t check it. Empathize, be kind and show compassion!"
1217,2020-11-29 13:08:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Make self-improvement your priority. Don’t concern yourself with what people think or say about you. Don’t worry about their behaviour, words and actions. Focus on being a better person each day that you have no time to judge others or speak of their shortcomings."
1218,2020-11-28 15:56:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Many waste time reminiscing what they’ve left behind. Don’t. If you keep looking back, you'll miss what's waiting for you ahead. Remember, where you are right now is where the Almighty wants you to be. He’s planned it that way. So brace yourself for the journey that awaits you!"
1219,2020-11-28 08:08:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Strive to make others happy, do it selflessly &amp; the Almighty will make sure you’re kept happy. Remember happiness begets happiness. Be concerned with beautifying your character rather than your physical being. Physical beauty will wither away but good character will last!"
1220,2020-11-27 21:57:24+00:00,muftimenk,The sad truth about hardship &amp; calamities is that they reveal your true friends &amp; real enemies. Who will help you? Who will distance themselves from you? Who will be there to just offer some kind words? You could probably count them on the fingers of one hand! That’s a fact!
1221,2020-11-27 03:54:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant ease to those facing any form of hardship. You know their needs better than anyone else. You know their pain, anxieties, worries &amp; fears. We pray for a breakthrough for them. Bless &amp; heal them from all their hurt. Refill them with strength &amp; restore their hope!"
1222,2020-11-26 18:47:18+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what the circumstances, don’t hurt others. Don’t be mean. You never know what the next person is going through. If you can’t say a nice word or do something pleasant, it’s best to remain silent. There’s so much evil in the world today, you don’t need to add to it!"
1223,2020-11-26 03:31:51+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let Satan make you doubt. He’s good at that. Doubt creates uncertainties in your heart &amp; mind. It makes you feel uneasy &amp; directionless. You need to anchor your faith firmly &amp; take control of your life. The Almighty is always there to steady you &amp; get you back on track!
1224,2020-11-25 16:08:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Sitting around, wasting time gossiping and judging others is not unfamiliar to many. They forget that such acts are a sin. Use the time wisely to improve yourself. Remember, tomorrow is not promised to anyone. So don’t waste your short life and start rearranging your priorities!"
1225,2020-11-25 04:13:48+00:00,muftimenk,You will feel frustrated at times. You will feel like everything is crumbling right before your eyes. You will feel that you can’t handle things on your own. You’re not supposed to! The Almighty loves it when you ask Him. Fervently. Ask with conviction. He will lift your load!
1226,2020-11-24 11:46:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Train yourself to be less angry and reactive to everything that’s being said about you. Every comment, every retort, every criticism; just take them all in your stride. Remember, silence often speaks volumes. Save your energy for that which really requires your involvement!"
1227,2020-11-24 05:22:58+00:00,muftimenk,How can you stay positive in a world that’s really quite bleak out there? Let’s admit it. It can be rather difficult at times. But the bottom line is: you should always thank the Almighty for what you have and trust Him for all your needs. Never doubt what He can do!

1229,2020-11-23 14:52:00+00:00,muftimenk,"While the world’s busy competing with one another, be among those who are busy competing with ourselves. Be better than you were yesterday. Work hard. Never put others down to elevate yourself. People will see through it. Be kind to all you meet. The right people will value you."
1230,2020-11-23 08:41:30+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what you’ve done in life, always believe that your transformation is possible. It’s only a call away. The Almighty’s waiting for you to turn back to Him. His Mercy is overwhelming, you could never imagine. So all is not lost if you seek His forgiveness and start over!"
1231,2020-11-22 17:28:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep some things private between you &amp; the Almighty. There are some things you need only to confide in Him alone! Remember, not everyone needs to know what you’re doing, what’s going on in your life etc. The less people know about you, the better. Privacy is a prized possession!"
1232,2020-11-22 09:01:12+00:00,muftimenk,"This disease is so rampant. Many suffer from it. Stop comparing yourself to others. Break the habit of feeling insecure, envious &amp; discontented with your life. One of the main reasons is social media! Remember, wanting what others have is a waste of time; live your own life!"
1233,2020-11-21 10:21:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Your mind can be your best friend or worst enemy. Train it well. If you don’t, it will assume it’s your master &amp; it shall do as it pleases, it will spiral into negativity, depression &amp; it becomes a force that drags you down instead of helping you. Always steer it to positivity!"
1234,2020-11-21 03:35:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Life’s a process. You can’t have a haphazard journey and expect to emerge top. Though you may not like what you are going through right now, your struggle is preparing you for your next level. Embrace the trials that come your way. Trust the Almighty to be your Guide &amp; Protector!"
1235,2020-11-20 22:13:30+00:00,muftimenk,You will be offended by some people at some point in your life. Don’t take it to heart. Don’t keep it inside you. Holding on to hurt and pain will only harm you in the long run.  Choose to forgive. Release the baggage of your past. Let it go and let the Almighty heal you!
1236,2020-11-20 03:15:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty.  Despite life’s uncertainties, we know You’re directing our steps towards all that’s good. May Your Mercy surround us every moment. Our hearts are strengthened because we have hope in You. We know You’ll open doors that we didn’t even knock on. Keep us firm in faith!"
1237,2020-11-19 20:18:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Even the most ""genuine"" people can fool you. In this day &amp; age it’s hard to tell who’s a true friend. So you go through life hoping people are being sincere &amp; genuine. But be prepared to be let down. It’s part of life. People will hurt you. Only the Almighty can heal you!"
1238,2020-11-19 03:25:03+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t complicate life. Don’t overthink. Don’t create problems that aren’t there in the first place. Live simply. There’s no need for excesses. The Almighty wants ease for us. He won’t burden us with that which we have no capacity to bear. So take life in your stride. Just live!
1239,2020-11-18 18:33:39+00:00,muftimenk,"There are some whose mission in life is to criticise, hate &amp; look for things negative. They bring absolutely no value to your life. Quit worrying about them. Don’t let them sidetrack you from your real cause. Let the Almighty deal with them. Focus on those with a positive impact!"
1240,2020-11-18 03:08:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind to yourself. Show yourself some mercy. Give yourself time and space to process all that’s going on in your mind. Don’t let anyone rush you or make you anxious. Remember, it’s your journey, nobody else’s. Take charge of it. Seek your strength from the One who made you!"
1241,2020-11-17 22:28:24+00:00,muftimenk,There will be things that happen in your life which you can’t comprehend. That’s okay. The Almighty works in amazing ways which our minds cannot fathom at times. Don’t try to understand everything. You’ll end up frustrated. You just have to trust Him. That’s where faith comes in!
1242,2020-11-17 03:41:11+00:00,muftimenk,Worry won’t get you far. Most of the things you worry about are insignificant. You can’t control them anyway. It’s the Almighty’s way of showing you who’s in charge. So focus on being the best version of yourself. Be a sterling example &amp; role model. Hand over the rest to Him!
1243,2020-11-16 18:34:58+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t suffer in silence. Don’t keep it all bottled up inside. Share it with the Almighty. Take Him into your confidence. Tell Him everything. He’s the only One who will listen and respond. He’s the only One who can and will give you that inner peace you long and crave for.
1244,2020-11-16 04:59:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit worrying! Learn to trust the Almighty in all circumstances, even when you can’t see the full picture. He knows what to give you, when to give you. He knows what you need &amp; when you need it. He knows how to put you at the right place at the right time with the right people."
1245,2020-11-15 11:36:51+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all felt helpless, hopeless and powerless many times. But giving up is never an option. Hope is what keeps us alive. So no matter what’s going on out there, cling on to hope, knowing that the Almighty is with us always. He knows what’s going on even when we don’t!"
1246,2020-11-15 03:21:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever the circumstances, pray! Pray when you’re happy. Pray when you’re confused &amp; sad. Pray when it hurts. Pray when you’re lost. Pray when those around you mock you for praying. Pray when you have no idea what’s going on. Pray in search of peace of mind. Stability. Serenity!"
1247,2020-11-14 08:09:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful how you use social media. It’s becoming more hostile recently. Never forget that social media is a tool. We decide how the tool is used. Use it to spread goodness &amp;  positivity; the ripple effects can be tremendous. Avoid bad words, no matter what they say about you!"
1248,2020-11-14 03:10:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Unfortunately, our society has low tolerance for those who fail. In fact, many success stories start with failure. Failure makes you tougher. It helps to redirect you in the right direction. Embrace failure for it’s a sign that you’re trying &amp; that’s good enough for the Almighty!"
1249,2020-11-13 22:01:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Help us understand that even when faced with fear &amp; anxiety, You’re there to comfort us. May we not fret &amp; worry over what lies ahead &amp; instead learn to trust You in all our affairs. When the world feels out of control, make us turn to prayer to calm our hearts. Aameen."
1250,2020-11-13 10:19:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We hand over everything to You, knowing that You’re the Best of Planners. Ease our worries of yesterday so that it doesn’t rob us of our peace today. Help us to focus on things that truly matter and to channel our energies for the best outcome."
1251,2020-11-12 22:23:50+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in a world that’s obsessed with gaining more. More wealth, fame, money, attention, friends, etc. We forget to appreciate what we have along the way. Don’t be surprised when the Almighty decides to take away what He’s blessed you with because you were so distracted!"
1252,2020-11-12 13:20:45+00:00,muftimenk,Understand the Almighty’s plan as you journey on. Accept the challenges along the way. Know that nothing happens by accident. Everything is carefully planned by the Master Planner. So don’t get upset when tests come your way. They are there for a reason. Keep moving forward.
1253,2020-11-12 06:30:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you the person who sees the glass as half full rather than half empty? Remember, being positive is one of the main things you need for survival. Your ability to do this, no matter what life throws at you is key to being happy &amp; appreciating where you are in life. Thank Him!"
1254,2020-11-11 21:58:57+00:00,muftimenk,"We suffer from information overload. Many people obsess over how much news &amp; updates they need to know to stay on top of things. In fact, learn to be mindful of how much news you consume. Learn to exercise restraint. You DON’T need to know everything!"
1255,2020-11-11 03:19:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s make today the day we change the way we respond to people &amp; things around us. We need to take control of how we react to things. Be conscious of the decisions we make. Remember, we don’t always get to choose the circumstances, but we certainly get to choose how we respond!"
1256,2020-11-10 21:32:43+00:00,muftimenk,You’re allowed to have questions &amp; you’ll not have the answers to everything that’s going on around you. That’s the Almighty’s job. Seek Him always. In good &amp; bad times. He’s always there for you. He’s your source of light. You don’t have to shoulder the shadows on your own.
1257,2020-11-10 06:35:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to stay calm in a world that is so chaotic today. Whatever you can’t control, hand it over to the Almighty. Do your best with the rest that life has offered you. Don’t compare yourself with others. We all deal with things differently. Accept the differences. Respectfully!"
1258,2020-11-09 23:08:51+00:00,muftimenk,Many of us are fooled into believing that strength is what we can do. No. Strength is more importantly overcoming the things we once thought we couldn't do. Learn to focus your heart and mind to it. Believe in yourself and seek help from the Almighty. You’ll get there eventually!
1259,2020-11-09 13:21:21+00:00,muftimenk,One of our biggest pitfalls is we assume we have time. So we put off till tomorrow what we were supposed to do today. Many thought the same. But death overtook them. Don’t lose out. Let this world run its race. We run after the Hereafter which is eternal. May we all get there!
1260,2020-11-08 21:57:21+00:00,muftimenk,"We feel exhausted at times, on the verge of giving up. We even lower our expectations. But we have to persevere because only the Almighty knows when the time is right. Keep our faith firm while waiting, trusting You always. Aameen"
1261,2020-11-08 13:10:02+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re not a failure. You’re not doomed. You’re not worthless. Everyone makes mistakes in life. Everyone falls. Even champions. The difference is they get up and try again. Have another go at it. Don’t stay down. Have firm faith. It’s not over yet. If you quit, that’s the end."
1262,2020-11-08 03:25:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have friends who will tell you what you need to hear rather than what you want to hear? If you do, you’re blessed. Such people are rare these days. They’re the ones who will keep you humble, keep you grounded, keep you sane &amp; keep you going. Remember to keep them close."
1263,2020-11-07 15:26:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to be less reactive for your own good. It’s easy to  blurt out what you feel in the heat of the moment without any regard for others. But remember, it takes only a few seconds of hurtful words to penetrate deep into someone’s heart. They may take years to heal, if at all!"
1264,2020-11-07 05:18:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let anyone belittle your efforts, no matter how small. If you’re doing your best, that’s all that matters. The Almighty has brought you this far. Look at where you are today. Quit overthinking. If you ever doubt yourself, remember how you started and how far you’ve come!"
1265,2020-11-06 19:31:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us peace of mind &amp; calm our troubled hearts. Remove all things that are causing stress, sorrow &amp;  grief in our lives. We lay our burdens before You; our worries, anxieties &amp; fear. Keep us constant in prayers &amp; may we always be grateful instead of wanting more!"
1266,2020-11-06 05:00:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You to lighten our load, grant us direction and strength to see through our day. We trust You to direct our steps and actions. May Your goodness and Mercy surround us always. Aameen."
1267,2020-11-05 14:13:10+00:00,muftimenk,Life has a way of unfolding when you least expect it. You’ll be betrayed by those you trusted. You’ll fall out with so-called friends. Don’t despair. The Almighty is in full control. He knows who should go &amp; who should stay. He will pave a way out for you. Keep going. Trust Him!
1268,2020-11-05 03:24:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Be committed to your spiritual growth. It’s not an easy journey. Satan is waiting &amp; lurking around the corner to sidetrack you. If you don't commit to it, slowly you’ll shift down, lose your vision &amp; start talking &amp; behaving like those who don't care about their Creator. Beware!"
1269,2020-11-04 16:51:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t jump to conclusions. Things aren’t always what they seem. Our conclusions may be logical but they may not be true. By refraining from making the wrong assumptions, we can avoid unnecessary pain &amp; conflict. So don’t be too quick to judge &amp; condemn. Instead,  be discerning!"
1270,2020-11-04 05:03:24+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty doesn’t care about your looks; what you do; who you know. He looks at your heart. Also you’re not defined by your past. It’s just the opposite with the world. People will look at all of the above &amp; more. Get your priorities right. Who matters more? It’s your choice!
1271,2020-11-03 22:08:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware what you think. Get rid of negative thoughts, assumptions, what ifs etc. They serve no purpose. If you keep replaying them, you’ll end up the loser. That’s what Satan wants. Most of the scenarios in your mind, won’t happen!  Clear out the cobwebs &amp; start seeing light!"
1272,2020-11-03 07:57:30+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty looks at your heart. Your connections, achievements, accolades etc don’t matter. He’s watching if you act out of kindness, love &amp; compassion. Or is it all about you. Society has become rather selfish. If your heart’s in the right place!, you’re on the right track!"
1273,2020-11-02 19:52:39+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re being tested again &amp; again &amp; you’re at breaking point. Hold on. Remember, a test can sometimes replace a worse misfortune; it could be a form of protection from something or being deprived of something. Take your tests in your stride, knowing He wants only good for you!"
1274,2020-11-02 12:30:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the company you keep. Not all are supporters. Not all will cheer you on or want to see you succeed. In fact, some are happy when you fall and fail. Such is life. These are people who are jealous of your blessings. They want what the Almighty has given you. Pray for them!"
1275,2020-11-02 04:03:07+00:00,muftimenk,"When things go wrong as they often do, learn to look for answers from within. The trouble is many will lash out at others and blame people around them. It’s easier to focus outward and get reactive. That’s unwise. Moreover, that seldom solves the problem and often makes it worse!"
1276,2020-11-01 21:13:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Cut down on social media interactions. If you belong to numerous chat groups and other online platforms, put them all on the back burner. Do it now and don’t procrastinate. They have a way of making you fritter your time away. Focus on your acts of worship. Life’s too short."
1277,2020-11-01 15:52:58+00:00,muftimenk,Remind yourself that everything is temporary; nothing lasts. You’re on a journey. You’ve not reached your final destination yet. An eternal abode awaits. The Hereafter. So quit stressing over everything that happens. Let the Almighty take over after you’ve done your best!
1278,2020-11-01 06:56:17+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what you’re going through, the Almighty can bring the greatest blessings even with the worst of circumstances. You’ve got to believe that nothing is impossible with the Lord of the Worlds. Seek Him constantly and He will direct your steps. Ask Him to strengthen you!"
1279,2020-10-31 16:06:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t keep things bottled up. It’s not healthy to hold your anxiety in. It can only get worse. Learn to open up, speak up and get help if you need to. There’s nothing wrong with that. We all need love and support. Seek your strength from the Almighty. He will pave a way out!"
1280,2020-10-31 07:37:20+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us understand every step of our journey in this life. Let us bear good patience as we wait for our prayers to be answered and Your blessings to be revealed. Help us to always trust that Your timing is perfect and that You always work in our best interest! Aameen!
1281,2020-10-30 18:26:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Today we thank You for all the blessings You’ve bestowed on us. Thank You for hearing all the unspoken words we couldn’t utter because the hurt was too much to bear. Thank You for mending all our wounds, seen &amp; unseen; and for making the pain more bearable. Aameen!"
1282,2020-10-30 00:26:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Amidst the uncertainty &amp; crisis facing us, we pray for the comfort &amp; safety of everyone across the globe. We need Your guidance &amp; direction. We are completely reliant on You, more so during these challenging times. May we always be grateful for what You have given us!"
1283,2020-10-29 21:03:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t get involved in people’s drama &amp; dysfunction. There’s a lot of that going on nowadays. As much as they try to engage you, take a step back. If they’re reasonable &amp; open to discussion, you could try advising them. Else, stay clear or you could lose your peace altogether!"
1284,2020-10-29 04:56:44+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how badly you’ve messed up, you’re NOT a failure. Don’t entertain that thought if it crosses your mind. As long as you’re seeking forgiveness &amp; trying to get close to the Almighty, He will forgive you. That’s our Merciful Lord. His approval is all you need!"
1285,2020-10-29 00:00:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Freedom of expression doesn’t give you the right to abuse and insult others. When you engage in such intentional provocation, expect a reaction where things may spiral out of control. Never forget that freedom comes with responsibility. Ethical and moral standards must remain!"
1286,2020-10-28 13:49:56+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re miserable because you put your hopes in unreliable, undependable people who are always letting you down. That’s what happens when you favour the creation over the Creator. Lay your trust in the One who is  omnipresent and constant. The Almighty will never let you down."
1287,2020-10-28 04:15:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Today, many lack basic respect usually due to poor upbringing. Remember, good manners &amp; good character are more crucial than outward beauty. When the world treats you badly &amp; everything is against you, do you turn around &amp; give it the same treatment? No! You treat it better."
1288,2020-10-27 18:52:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Forgive and move on. It’s powerful. It’s an act of kindness. It’s the beginning of healing. Yet many refuse to do so, preferring to cling on to grudges, resentment &amp; payback time. It’s not worth it. Life’s too short for all that drama. Just forgive &amp; keep that peace in you."
1289,2020-10-27 08:35:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't insult others or mock them no matter who they are or what they believe. Don't curse or abuse, don't disrespect. You gain absolutely nothing by doing that. In fact, you will make many enemies. Sleep in peace every night knowing you haven't wronged a soul in any way."
1290,2020-10-26 22:50:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to be at peace with yourself. It’s something you have to do consciously. It won’t happen overnight. When you finally achieve it, nothing &amp; no one can affect you. You’re totally in sync with your innermost self. No negativity can touch you! Feel the  difference!"
1291,2020-10-26 08:33:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fall into the trap of letting others snatch away your confidence. People tend to do that with their words and actions. Know their agenda. Don’t shrink back. As long as you’re doing what’s right, go forth. Remember, in the end, only the Almighty’s opinion matters!"
1292,2020-10-25 16:47:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Never think you’ve messed up too much that the Almighty won’t forgive you. He will &amp; always will as long as you’re repenting &amp; seeking forgiveness. Don’t let Satan make you feel otherwise. So no matter how far you’ve strayed, turn to Him without hesitation! Don’t procrastinate!"
1293,2020-10-25 01:54:57+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Constantly remind us that eventually everything will work out. You’re in complete control. Help us wait patiently for what You have in store for us. Help us cultivate the right attitude. It’s not easy at times; but let it be worth it. Open the doors before us!

1295,2020-10-24 08:18:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop stressing over things. The Almighty will work it out for you eventually. You have to trust Him. Remember, you don’t have to chase whatever He sends. That’s right! Because if you’re truly committed to His cause, the blessings will chase you ."
1296,2020-10-23 19:50:14+00:00,muftimenk,"If you ever doubt that you’ll make it through your trials, look back and see how the Almighty has favoured you and blessed you with so much. Know that it didn’t happen by accident. He planned it meticulously for you. Don’t take it for granted. Thank Him for all the goodness."
1297,2020-10-23 10:45:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Amidst the choas &amp; confusion, we pray for peace &amp; prosperity in Nigeria. Safeguard its citizens &amp; guide its leaders to do what’s right. Protect #Nigeria from harm &amp; those who intend to create turmoil, discord, hate &amp; unrest. Grant it positive growth &amp; success. Aameen"
1298,2020-10-22 23:14:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. When calamities and storms come into our lives, help us take them in our stride. Keep the peace and tranquility, simply because the hardship won’t last. When we feel broken, heal us so we can be whole again. May we always be under your protection. Aameen!"
1299,2020-10-22 16:21:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t get discouraged when things don’t happen according to your timing. Pray that the Almighty grants you ultimate patience while you wait. Constantly remind yourself that the longer it takes, the more He has in store for you. You will be surprised &amp; overjoyed with the outcome!"
1300,2020-10-22 03:10:28+00:00,muftimenk,One of the biggest problems we face in our lives today is distraction! There’s too much going on around us that it’s hard to stay focused. Everything screams for our attention. Don't waste time on anything that doesn't improve and enhance your life in any way. Stay vigilant!
1301,2020-10-21 18:58:32+00:00,muftimenk,You don’t have to apologise if the answer is no! Be upfront &amp; honest when you say it. Do it for self-care. Many can’t say no because they don’t want to appear rude or ill-mannered; &amp; they’re concerned about the opinion of others. This is harmful behaviour. You’ve got to stop it!
1302,2020-10-21 12:20:35+00:00,muftimenk,People can only make you feel inferior if you give them the power to do so. Don’t do that. You don’t need their approval for anything in your life. The only approval you need is from the Almighty and no one else. Lay your trust in Him no matter what you’re going through in life.
1303,2020-10-21 03:28:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Your cries to the Almighty are more than just tears. He knows what you’re feeling, what you’re saying even though you’re not articulating. He’s the Lord of the Worlds. So remember, even though you feel like you’re in a dark place right now, His light will shine through. Hold on."
1304,2020-10-20 18:38:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Embrace pain. It’s part of the process. Nothing good is achieved when it’s all smooth sailing. Expect knocks, disappointment, falls etc. They allow you to grow into a better version of yourself. You have to trust the journey. The Almighty will grant you victory as a result!"
1305,2020-10-20 03:42:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Take life in your stride. Focus on your tasks and don’t get distracted. Leave the rest to the Almighty. Cut out the noise outside and don’t worry about trivial and petty issues. Remember, fitting in, people’s opinions of you etc don’t matter eventually. Life’s too short!"
1306,2020-10-19 19:16:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop comparing. Start cherishing what you have before it’s taken away from you. Gratitude is key. Be hopeful about what’s coming. Always believe that the Almighty wants good for us. He has blessed us with so much, more than we’ve asked for. Move forward with prayer &amp; firm faith!"
1307,2020-10-19 06:26:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Cut out gossip. Cut out backbiting. Cut out empty chatter and wasting time. Fix yourself first. Get busy with self-improvement. Work on being a better version of yourself. At the end of the day, it’s really me vs me. You’re accountable for your own  actions. Nobody else’s!"
1308,2020-10-18 20:56:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you don’t understand what’s going on, it doesn’t mean you give up hope and throw in the towel. Keep asking the Almighty. Keep crying out to Him for what you need. He knows what’s coming next, even if you don’t. Your job is to trust Him. Press on!"
1309,2020-10-18 09:51:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Correct others by all means but do it in a tasteful manner that they don’t get upset, defensive or even aggressive. Do it gently with kindness. Sometimes when you give advice, people become worse off than they were before you gave them advice because of the way you did it!"
1310,2020-10-18 04:12:35+00:00,muftimenk,Stop overthinking. Calm down. Spiritual growth takes time. It doesn’t happen overnight. Just because your progress is not obvious does not mean nothing is happening. Keep praying. Keep believing. The Almighty’s in full control. He’ll make things happen when the time is right!
1311,2020-10-17 18:06:53+00:00,muftimenk,"People will have an opinion of you &amp; there is nothing you can do about it. It’s become easier to do that especially hiding behind the keyboard. It requires no accountability, no understanding. How about we cultivate empathy instead; the ability to feel what  others are feeling?"
1312,2020-10-17 04:03:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us the strength that we need to face today. There are things happening around us that we do not understand. At times, we feel weak, helpless &amp; even afraid. We know You’re in full control &amp; we trust You. Have mercy on us as we struggle to endure life’s hardships!"
1313,2020-10-16 22:01:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop putting yourself down.  Stop doubting how far you’ve come. Stop regretting the choices you’ve made. Satan will make you think otherwise. His job is to make you miserable and depressed. Don’t cave in. Always encourage, support and believe in yourself. That’s the way forward!"
1314,2020-10-16 04:47:04+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Keep purifying our hearts of any resentment towards others. Help us to always be aware &amp; conscious of You &amp; to realise that our life is temporary. You can take us back any moment. Help us appreciate the value of time &amp; to be aware of how precious &amp; fleeting it is!
1315,2020-10-15 06:53:23+00:00,muftimenk,"If you don't do it their way, it doesn't mean you're wrong, inferior or off the track. Let them say what they want. They'll never stop hurling abuse at you. Don't be distracted by their noise. Your worth is decided by the Almighty. Be dedicated to Him alone, not them. He knows."
1316,2020-10-14 23:19:56+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of constant distraction, focus is crucial in our relationship with the Almighty. This focus is not only meant for our daily prayers, but should stretch to every aspect of our lives. Living a distracted life leads nowhere as you’ll fall prey to the tricks of Satan!"
1317,2020-10-14 16:48:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Being hurt is unpleasant. More so if it’s by someone close to you or a person you care about. But it’s really unavoidable. In reality, that’s life. Don’t think too much about it. Let the Almighty heal you. Only He can. Gather your inner strength. Move on &amp; push through the pain!"
1318,2020-10-14 11:16:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Always be kind to those you meet along the way in life. Remember, we’re all on a journey. Your journey is not the same as mine. And mine is not the same as yours. If we meet on a certain path, may we encourage each other and build each other up instead of tearing each other down."
1319,2020-10-13 18:49:16+00:00,muftimenk,Avoid the company of those who are  constantly complaining about other people. They make no effort to hide their discontent. Don't let them drag you into their pit of despair. Stay out of it but try to make them realise that they are the source of their own discontent!
1320,2020-10-12 22:25:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Do your best and leave the rest to the Almighty. Think of all the times He’s brought you back on course when you felt lost. As long as you’re seeking Him, He will respond. The trauma, the scars, the suffering you thought would never end but He strengthened you through it all!"
1321,2020-10-12 12:29:45+00:00,muftimenk,What got to you was never meant to miss you and what missed you was never ever meant to get to you! So don’t stress over what happens in life. Thank the Almighty for everything because the Lord of the Worlds is in full control. He knows what’s best for you  always!
1322,2020-10-12 00:03:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t expect everyone to share your vision &amp; goals. Even those close to you may not. That’s life. We are all made differently. Your vision is unique to you. The Almighty crafted them specially for you. When you leave Him out of the equation, that’s when your vision becomes blur!"
1323,2020-10-11 10:44:42+00:00,muftimenk,"This year has taught us that no matter how meticulously you plan your life, the Almighty has the last say &amp; the veto powers. That’s why it’s so important to live every moment &amp; not take things for granted. Here today, gone tomorrow. We’ve seen that happen too often. Just live!"
1324,2020-10-10 23:02:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop procrastinating. When the Almighty opens a door for you be prepared to walk through it. But for some, it’s an opportunity lost because they’re too lazy to make the move in the direction that He has paved for them. Remember, an opportunity lost may never be regained."
1325,2020-10-10 16:57:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Trust the Almighty with full conviction; with all your heart. Don’t lean on your own understanding. Often with our limited knowledge, we’re not able to see the whole picture. But He knows what we don’t. Acknowledge Him in all that you’re going through &amp; He will direct your way."
1326,2020-10-09 22:51:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We have many things we’re worried about bombarding our brains. We know You’re in full control of everything and we’re not. We hand them over to You because of Your infinite Wisdom and Mercy. Grant us peace of mind, knowing that You always want the best for us. Aameen."
1327,2020-10-09 08:31:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us guidance.
Show us which way to turn.
Calm our anxious thoughts. 
Strengthen us as we often falter and feel weary. Give us strength in our hearts and clarity of vision to go through our daily affairs. We know that You’re with us in our journey. Aameen."
1328,2020-10-08 21:10:57+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s time to inhale the future and exhale the past. It’s easy to look back and ask all the “whys” and “ifs” but honestly it’s not going to change anything. Instead, gather the lessons the Almighty wanted you to learn along the way and move ahead with full trust in your heart!"
1329,2020-10-08 07:42:41+00:00,muftimenk,"There are people who will go out of their way for others. They’ll be there when times are rough, always ready with a listening ear. Don’t forget to check on them too. They may be facing struggles known only to them. Their cup may be empty having poured everything out for others!"
1330,2020-10-07 23:30:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Practice, patience &amp; perseverance. These are essential ingredients if you want to excel in whatever you’re doing, Nothing comes easy. The Almighty has equipped you with the faculties &amp; capabilities. Put them to good use. Sitting around,  waiting for things to happen won’t work!"
1331,2020-10-07 16:11:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be discouraged when you see others doing well. Don’t begrudge your friend for getting that job you’ve been eyeing for a while. You are almost there. What the Almighty is giving you requires patience, focus and commitment! Your time will come when He  makes it happen!"
1332,2020-10-07 08:28:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus on what matters. Choose positivity always. Negativity is not the vibe you want. If you allow it, negativity can sap your energy &amp; leave you feeling drained. It can kill your inner peace. Recognise these symptoms &amp; learn to make better choices. Leave the outside noise out!"
1333,2020-10-06 20:12:09+00:00,muftimenk,Nothing lasts.  Even some of the people the Almighty sends our way are only meant to accompany us temporarily. Don’t be upset when He moves people out of your life. It’s His Plan. You need to carry on your journey. You’ll meet more along the way. He’s keeping an eye on you!
1334,2020-10-06 05:36:40+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t allow the hectic pace of your life to keep you away from praying. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by life’s responsibilities. Don’t. Take it in your stride. Don’t trade the  connection with your Creator for worldly things. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to he heard by Him!
1335,2020-10-05 12:31:34+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is most of us have more than we need. We have practically all the basic necessities and more. Sadly, we tend to look at the few things we don't have &amp; become depressed &amp; despondent. Be careful because the Almighty doesn’t like ingratitude. He can take it away. Anytime!"
1336,2020-10-05 03:09:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re healing from, be patient with yourself. Healing takes time. One minute you feel better, the next minute you’re down again. Expect the highs and lows. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Only He can heal you. Have faith in the process. You’ll emerge stronger!"
1337,2020-10-04 17:56:36+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty knows you’re doing your best. He knows you’re tired. He hears the prayers &amp; sees the tears. Keep pressing forward. He won’t try you beyond your means. When you least expect it, doors will open, breakthroughs will come. The wait won’t be in vain! Trust Him!"
1338,2020-10-04 10:58:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste time seeking people’s approval. They’re a hard lot to please &amp; whatever you do will never be good enough. There will always be that one person who’s waiting to nitpick. Instead, spend time building your relationship with the Almighty. You’ll never be disappointed!"
1339,2020-10-03 20:37:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be among those who constantly feed their material desires while neglecting their souls. Most people focus on material things like houses, jobs, cars etc forgetting that balance is essential in life if you’re to attain contentment and inner peace. Prioritise what matters!"
1340,2020-10-03 08:16:32+00:00,muftimenk,The best life lessons are often learnt when you’re broken badly. When you think you’ve hit rock bottom &amp; can’t see a way out. But don’t forget that some of the greatest blessings in life become apparent &amp; come through your most difficult trials. So take heart. Never lose hope!
1341,2020-10-03 00:27:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you among those who treat others according to your temperament? If you’re happy, then you treat people kindly. And if you happen to be in a bad mood, you treat them any way you please, often in a bad manner. This is an ugly behaviour. Stay consistent in how you treat others!"
1342,2020-10-02 14:04:21+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us to not stray into the temptations of this world. Keep us on the right path &amp; let us be good examples for generations to come. Give us a deep sense of modesty that will be reflected in our external conduct. Protect us from that which will incur Your Wrath!
1343,2020-10-02 04:17:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep our hearts &amp; minds pure &amp; our paths straight. Help us to be discerning always &amp; not to just conform to whatever life throws at us. May we take what’s good, acceptable &amp; pleasing to You. Give us the strength to control our thoughts &amp; speak what is true &amp; honourable!"
1344,2020-10-01 22:05:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fall into the trap of publicising your sins on social media. Some people think it’s cool. It’s not. Keep your sins private between you and the Almighty. Repent soonest possible. When you show pride in the sin, that’s  worrying. You probably won’t be repenting for it too."
1345,2020-10-01 11:12:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful. There are many insecure &amp; manipulative people out there who will use &amp; abuse you. If you’ve fallen victim, forgive yourself for the bad decisions you’ve made. Move on with a better mindset. Such people will always exist. Be mindful the next time, with hindsight!"
1346,2020-09-30 23:19:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose peace over attention. Today, many crave attention that sometimes they do it at the expense of what is priceless. Yes. Peace. You often see the most mundane detail of someone’s life on social media, expecting likes &amp; comments. Stay away from the fray. Maintain your dignity."
1347,2020-09-30 08:22:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Will you help someone even if you know you’ll get nothing in return? The truth is anyone can help when there’s something in it for them but to help when there’s nothing to be gained shows a beautiful heart! It shows true sincerity. If you know someone like that, you’re blessed!"
1348,2020-09-29 23:48:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything goes according to His Divine Decree. That’s why life always works out because He wants the best for you. Even if it’s not according to your original plan, it’ll be in your favour. Find comfort knowing that everything you’re going through won’t last. Trust the process!"
1349,2020-09-29 11:56:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Oftentimes when you’re having a bad day, it’s because of your mindset. How often do you stress over things because you want more. You’re never content. Nothing is good enough. Adopt an attitude of gratitude. You’ll realise that life is more than enough. Learn to be grateful!"
1350,2020-09-29 04:02:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember the basic rule of life. You reap what you sow. Life’s often what you make of it. So don’t be upset when you didn’t get what you had expected because you didn’t put in the effort &amp; didn’t do the work! That’s the brutal truth. The sooner you embrace that, the better!"
1351,2020-09-28 16:23:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Be in the company of good, positive people; those who are good for your mental health. Not those who will pick on you constantly &amp; knock you down for the slightest wrong. During tough times like this, it’s crucial to keep your inner peace. Don’t let anything or anyone rattle you!"
1352,2020-09-28 07:17:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t give up on your loved ones. Remember, not everyone will be on the same path as you and that’s life. Your job is to constantly pray for them, waiting for that turning point in their lives. Keep going. It will happen if the Almighty wills. Guidance comes from Him alone!"
1353,2020-09-27 23:21:49+00:00,muftimenk,"The higher you climb, the harder you fall. You’ve heard the saying. While that doesn’t necessarily have to be the case, in the midst of success, it’s important to remain grounded. Humility is key. Don’t let success get to your head. Remember, nothing happens without His Will."
1354,2020-09-27 15:54:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Why do some people find it hard to compliment others? It reinforces positive self-esteem. As much as we like to receive compliments, it’s equally important to be willing to give them. Being able to recognize good things in others is a sign of emotional intelligence &amp; maturity!"
1355,2020-09-27 05:19:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Listen with the intention to understand rather than to merely respond when discussing an issue. But oftentimes, we get so caught up with putting our points across that we forget to listen to what’s being said. Be fair, remain calm and committed to hearing each other out."
1356,2020-09-26 21:52:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you understand the workings of Satan? He is always there, lurking around to attack you. Do not let him win! Stand firm &amp; resolute. Fight back with prayer. Be unflinching in your faith. Be absolutely sure what needs to be done. Seek the Almighty’s help always. He’ll guide you!"
1357,2020-09-26 12:29:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Disappointment, setback, defeat are all temporary. The Almighty puts them in your path to strengthen you, not destroy you. How you react  and respond to it will show your mettle; the kind of person that you are. Keep going. Don’t give up. Giving up is what makes it permanent."
1358,2020-09-26 04:32:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The biggest enemy to contentment is the yearning for what we don’t have. How often do you tell yourself, I’ll be happy when I get this promotion or that job? This is conditional happiness; it may never happen! In fact, it will ruin your chance at happiness. Live in the moment!"
1359,2020-09-25 17:47:28+00:00,muftimenk,Always ask the Almighty to protect our hearts from hardening. May He soften them and allow us to have compassion for those who are suffering in unimaginable ways. Learn to pray passionately for them as we do for ourselves and our loved ones. May He keep us humble at all times!
1360,2020-09-25 10:10:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Avoid overthinking. Don’t read too much into things. Don’t delve and dig into something looking for issues when there are none or at least not obvious. Don’t complicate things when they’re really quite simple and easily understood. Remember, simplicity is part of faith."
1361,2020-09-25 04:17:54+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Protect us from hypocrisy. Make us honour every word that comes from our mouth. Give us humility to see how far from perfect we are and how badly we need You in our lives. Help us to live lives that glorify You. Help us to realize when we’re being judgemental of others!
1362,2020-09-24 21:09:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Know your self-worth. You might feel unwanted &amp; unworthy to one person, but you are priceless to another.  Spend time with those who value you. No matter how good you are to others, there’ll always be that one negative person who criticizes you.  Smile, carry on &amp; do your thing!"
1363,2020-09-24 13:12:46+00:00,muftimenk,Something you’ve been working on for a while didn’t work out. Don’t throw in the towel. Don’t fret. The Almighty knows the reason. He wants you to move forward. He wants you to let go of what didn’t work out yesterday &amp; trust that He is leading you towards goodness. Keep moving!
1364,2020-09-23 21:53:00+00:00,muftimenk,"The future is ahead of you. Stop hankering for what was &amp; what you’ve left behind. Move on! Do not look back! Remember that everything happens for a reason. Review your past, learn the lessons meant for you. Be excited about what’s ahead &amp; what the Almighty has planned for you!"
1365,2020-09-23 08:23:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Many will promise to do things for you but when it comes to the crunch, they’ll not keep to their word. Try not to depend on people. If you have to, be prepared to be disappointed. Remember, you are what you do, not what you say you’ll do. Rely on no one but the One who made you!"
1366,2020-09-22 22:35:06+00:00,muftimenk,Hold on to your faith. Stay firm &amp; resolute. Don’t let circumstances sway you like a candle in the wind. Never doubt that the Almighty’s aware of everything that’s going on. Don’t let others create doubts in your mind. He has brought you this far. Do you think He’ll abandon you?
1367,2020-09-22 14:57:30+00:00,muftimenk,There’s a blessing when you’re down and at your lowest. The only way you can move is up. Thank the Almighty for it because He will raise you if you seek Him. Keep reaching out to Him and you’ll be amazed by what follows. Your experience and breakthrough will be phenomenal!
1368,2020-09-22 10:26:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be full of pride and arrogance just because you’ve done good deeds. It’s up to the Almighty to accept it, though we must never lose hope in His Mercy. This is the only way to keep our hearts rooted to our faith. So keep doing good, no matter what is going on around you!"
1369,2020-09-21 22:24:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing lasts. That’s right. Not even the ache in your heart. Everything is transient in this temporary world. So everything that you’re experiencing will give way to something better. The Almighty has promised us. So put Your trust in Him. He decrees everything, lest you forget."
1370,2020-09-21 10:16:05+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste time trying to change people’s perceptions &amp; opinions of you. Most have already made up their minds. Many have preconceived ideas based on what they’ve heard through the grapevine. Keep doing good. Your work is there for everyone to see. The truth will always prevail!
1371,2020-09-20 23:10:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Saying yes is a good thing mostly. But learning how to set boundaries &amp; say no when the need calls for it is key to healthy relationships with others &amp; yourself! Saying yes to everyone leads to stress, being overwhelmed &amp; burned out. So listen to your body &amp; don’t feel guilty!"
1372,2020-09-20 12:49:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you worried about being popular &amp; loved by the masses? If you choose to get closer to the Almighty &amp; live a life according to His Plan, you’ll find yourself walking alone mostly. This is the reality. Don’t be afraid. Don’t worry. Let Him take over as your Guide &amp; Protector!"
1373,2020-09-20 05:44:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be daunted by the road ahead. Yes, it may seem long. But the Almighty has it all planned for you. You need to start the journey even if it’s with baby steps. You will pick up speed and your pace will quicken as you move along. Distractions aside, we will all get there!"
1374,2020-09-19 23:00:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to live with criticism. It’s part of life. In this day and age, you’ll face critics at every turn; everywhere you go. Take it in your stride. Don’t stress over it. If it’s constructive criticism, use it to improve yourself. If it’s destructive, ignore it. Let it go!"
1375,2020-09-19 13:52:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Even when you feel lonely, you’re never really alone. The Almighty is always there for you. You don't have to live your life alone. He promises never to leave nor forsake you. He is ever faithful. Don't trade Him for anything. Make Him your priority. He will never disappoint!"
1376,2020-09-19 03:57:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let anyone belittle you. If you’re not careful, you may start believing their demeaning remarks. This can affect your self-esteem. When someone belittles you, it’s a reflection of them, not you! Never allow people who use words so irresponsibly to sabotage your self-image!"
1377,2020-09-18 18:33:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you feeling tired &amp; discouraged? To get out of the rut, you need to change your mindset. Adopt positive thoughts. Believe that the Almighty wants good for you. He will give you strength &amp; power to overcome. Start moving towards Him. Trust the process &amp; feel the difference."
1378,2020-09-18 04:07:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You for a heart that’s pure; free from grudges, malice &amp; all things evil. Keep compassion alive in us. Help us refrain from judging others as we’ve not walked in their shoes. Keep our hearts at ease; make us pleased with Your Decree. We ask for Your Mercy always."
1379,2020-09-17 15:06:07+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be disillusioned with life. Not everyone will appreciate what you do for them. Don’t be discouraged as there are many ungrateful people out there. You just have to figure out who’s worth your efforts &amp; who’s merely using you. Focus your energy on what pleases the Almighty.
1380,2020-09-17 04:01:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you find it hard to forgive those who’ve wronged you? Learn to cultivate a generous &amp; caring spirit. It’ll serve as a reminder of the importance of showing mercy to others. We can be so harsh to each other over small things, but don’t we hope for the Almighty’s Mercy?"
1381,2020-09-16 22:03:44+00:00,muftimenk,"We care so much for our physical being but how about our soul? It’s the soul that lives on, not our bodies which we so painstakingly look after. Remember, anyone can feed your stomach but only you can feed your soul. Start today by doing what the Almighty has prescribed."
1382,2020-09-16 13:30:22+00:00,muftimenk,"We embody what we talk about. If you’re always having a negative mindset, always complaining, doubting, making a big deal of all your problems, then you’re bringing all the wrong things to life. Your words can take you away from your destiny. Think positive. Act positively!"
1383,2020-09-16 05:45:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Very sadly, we lost a good brother today in Harare, Zimbabwe. Ashraff Bhagoo was shot by armed robbers while responding to a call of help! Our prayers are with him and his family! May the Almighty grant him the loftiest ranks of Paradise. Aameen https://t.co/ZH5PIQQD3v"
1384,2020-09-16 04:18:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When you decide to move ahead in life, you may need to let go of people from your past. Why? Because they’re normally stuck in a mindset that sees you for who you used to be. They’re not receptive to change. So surround yourself with people who build your future not your past!"
1385,2020-09-15 22:24:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t curse delays. No matter how much you hate it. It’s human nature to want things to happen when we want them. But the truth is, behind every delay, there's a blessing. Do not regard every delay as negative. Remember, the Almighty knows what we don’t.  So lay your full trust!"
1386,2020-09-15 13:03:58+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let life weigh you down. You’ve come this far because the Almighty has a plan for your life. Otherwise you won’t be here. Believe it. Embrace the journey. Don’t see each day as a chore. Treat it as a blessing. Not many get to experience it. Be grateful. Thank Him.
1387,2020-09-15 03:55:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you know what happiness is? Happiness is a state of mind. Yes. Oftentimes, we expect everything to be perfect for us to be happy. No! Things don’t have to be perfect, but you need only to have peace of mind to achieve it. Be at peace with yourself and happiness will follow."
1388,2020-09-14 17:15:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste this life. Give it your best because He will open the necessary doors for you to move ahead. He will show you the right way, He will be your light in the dark, your shelter in the storm, your best company in moments of loneliness &amp; He will be your peace even in chaos!"
1389,2020-09-14 04:19:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t give up on yourself. You’re all you have. No matter how hard it is right now, push forward. That’s what the Almighty wants you to do. It will get better with time. Believe that. One step at a time. One foot in front of the other and before you know it, you’ll get there!"
1390,2020-09-13 22:48:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t allow one moment, one incident, one mistake, one chapter to define your entire life! It doesn’t work that way. Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. You may feel your tests are harder than most but the Almighty tests each one of us differently!"
1391,2020-09-13 11:25:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do, don’t change your behaviour pattern just to gain people’s approval. Remember, most will only like what you do for them. They’re not interested in anything else. If you’re worried about people liking and respecting you, start by liking and respecting yourself!"
1392,2020-09-13 04:15:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever you feel defeated, remember that the Almighty is the strength in your weakness. Constantly connect with Him in your daily affairs. Always ask Him to protect you from acting out of irrational decisions that lead to bad consequences. Always take a step back when needed!"
1393,2020-09-12 08:52:03+00:00,muftimenk,People will often try to find fault with what you do &amp; who you are. Faultfinders &amp; accusers are aplenty. Don’t pay any heed to them. Don’t let them into your head. Fill your thoughts with how to get closer to the Almighty. Reject the empty chatter that’s trying to distract you.
1394,2020-09-11 22:31:22+00:00,muftimenk,Losing a loved one is never easy; whether sudden or foreseen it’s always heartbreaking. Grief can wreak havoc on our overall well being. That’s why it’s important to stay rooted to the Almighty. Only He can lessen your heartache &amp; comfort you in such times. Seek refuge in Him.
1395,2020-09-11 12:49:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Understand that your success will bother some people. In fact, it will offend those who want to control you. They will go out of their way to tarnish your reputation and spread untruths about you. Don’t worry about them. They have no power over you. The Almighty will see to it!"
1396,2020-09-11 04:07:10+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Keep us away from sinful behaviour. Help those who have fallen into less desirable conditions &amp; gone off course to get back to You. Soften their hearts so they may connect with You again through prayer. Constantly remind us that we’re dependent on You &amp; not ourselves!
1397,2020-09-10 22:19:41+00:00,muftimenk,Growth can be uncomfortable. Don’t resist it. Embrace it because it’s developing your character. It’s building endurance. It’s getting you prepared for the next stage of your development. Thank the Almighty for choosing you. He’s granting favour for your future. Be grateful!
1398,2020-09-10 14:03:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The challenges we face can leave us beaten. Couple it with anxiety, worry, stress etc, even the strongest will feel the effects. Remember, everyone struggles with issues in their lives. Having the right attitude to combat challenges are crucial for mental &amp; emotional health!"
1399,2020-09-10 06:50:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Give generously. It’s not just about money. Give your time, a smile, a helping hand, be a blessing to someone you meet. Have an attitude that’s filled with mercy &amp; kindness. Do all this without expecting anything in return from people. The Almighty will bless you in abundance!"
1400,2020-09-09 21:50:28+00:00,muftimenk,You’ve got to believe that your best days are ahead. Right there in front of you. You have to keep going. Never mind where you’ve been. Never mind if it felt like the pits of hell. What’s to come is more important. The Almighty has promised He won’t test us beyond our capacity!
1401,2020-09-09 08:29:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't engage in sin. When they gossip, backbite etc; make sure you remind them to stop. If they don't take heed, then excuse yourself from such company. Don’t be a leaking bucket &amp; waste your good deeds by remaining in the presence of gossip or engaging in it!"
1402,2020-09-08 22:59:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of oppressing others especially when you’re in a position of power. The Almighty is All-Knowing, All-Seeing. You may think you’re getting away with it but wait! Be it in this world or the next or perhaps both, a severe punishment awaits. You’ll never get away scot-free!"
1403,2020-09-08 08:39:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of your reactions. When you’re negative, it will bring about negative consequences. Always choose kindness, love and compassion over anger, pride, jealousy, arrogance and malice. Learn to respond in a positive manner. It will have a huge impact on your life!"
1404,2020-09-07 17:47:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you find yourself facing trial after trial, hardship after hardship? Don’t despair. Bear good patience and keep glorifying the Almighty. He will make a way out for you. From all your trials and tribulations. It’s only a matter of time. Don’t lose hope in His Mercy! Soldier on!"
1405,2020-09-07 04:30:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Our weakest moments show up the strength of our faith. When the storm hits, what do we do? Is the Almighty the first One we turn to for help? Involve Him from the start. He’s the only One who will help you in your lowest moments. Don’t count on others. They’ll fail you miserably!"
1406,2020-09-06 23:02:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t use mean words on people. It’s often hurtful or even worse, derogatory. Although people sometimes don’t mean what they say, once spoken, it’ll be hard to retract your words. It’s good practice to always choose your words wisely. Give people the respect they deserve!"
1407,2020-09-06 12:26:40+00:00,muftimenk,Not everyone will like you. Not everyone will support you. Not everyone will give you the honour you deserve. Don’t let it bother you. That’s life basically. You need to realise that the Almighty is in full control. You don’t need anyone to fulfil your destiny. Only He matters!
1408,2020-09-05 17:41:02+00:00,muftimenk,Are you a people pleaser? Do you always need validation from others? Do you live your life based on the opinions of others because you are afraid of disappointing them. Be wary. People will try to mould and shape you into what they want you to be. Learn to say no. Refuse kindly!
1409,2020-09-05 08:29:42+00:00,muftimenk,We're graded based on how well we did in our exams. Do you know of those whose success is largely measured by the performance of others? Teachers! Let's appreciate them for choosing such a challenging profession only to contribute to the betterment of mankind. Our unsung heroes!
1410,2020-09-05 04:28:55+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t keep blaming others each time something goes wrong. Don’t keep looking for scapegoats. Be mature enough to stop complaining and take full responsibility for everything. Assess the situation and realize your mistake. Learn from it and try no to repeat it. That’s maturity!
1411,2020-09-04 23:13:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop seeking approval from people. The truth is it’s a never ending process. The more you seek it, the more you’ll want it. You’ll get to a stage where you can’t move on till you get people’s approval. Stop in your tracks! The only approval you need is from the One who made you!"
1412,2020-09-04 10:24:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop allowing people to waste your time. Time is one of the precious gifts from the Almighty. Respect it. If you don’t value your time, others won’t too. So set clear examples. Be disciplined. Finish tasks on time! Don’t be late for meetings! And don’t forget to pray on time!"
1413,2020-09-03 23:49:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Constantly remind us that we will all be returning to You, without exception; that our lives can end in a heartbeat. Young or old, when it’s time to go, we go. Help us make the best of our time here to prepare for what’s to come. The eternal, the everlasting. Aameen."
1414,2020-09-03 14:43:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have a heavy heart that’s filled with worry &amp; cares of this world? Learn to let things go bit by bit, especially those things which you can’t control. The Almighty is the best Disposer of all your affairs. Learn to trust him unequivocally. Peace will reign in your heart!"
1415,2020-09-03 04:15:02+00:00,muftimenk,How often do you stop and think of just how blessed you are? The constant desire for more prevents us from being truly content with what we already have. Learn to be grateful for where you are in your life right now. Try it. You will see the difference! Gratitude is key!
1416,2020-09-02 23:00:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be easily impressed by social status, job titles and the likes. Many have these but it has never got them far in life! Why? Because they lack basic human decency. Remember, how you treat people speaks volumes about you. The Almighty’s watching. Don’t shortchange yourself!"
1417,2020-09-02 14:16:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you ever been so engrossed in your problems that you think you’re the only one facing it? Remember, there’s a reason why things happen the way they do. The Almighty has a plan for everything that you experience. Sooner or later, you’ll see the light of day &amp; thank Him!"
1418,2020-09-02 06:35:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop beating yourself when things happen. Focus more on the positives. You have to stop comparing yourself to others. Be kind to yourself. We all make mistakes. Consider them as learning opportunities. Above all, be patient with yoursel. It’s a quality endeared by the Almighty!"
1419,2020-09-01 15:27:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you spiritually arrogant? Do you think that those who are not on your level are doomed and not even worth reaching out to and helping them out! Always remember, we all started somewhere. No one became pious overnight! Let your knowledge soften your heart not harden it!"
1420,2020-09-01 04:04:04+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how sad or low you feel, don’t opt for a temporary high by going against what the Almighty has prescribed. It is foolish, it won’t last and you’ll end up feeling worse as a result. It will rob you of your inner peace and you’ll incur His Wrath. It’s just not worth it!"
1421,2020-08-31 17:13:04+00:00,muftimenk,"We are a quick fix generation. Everything must happen now; at the flick of a switch or the press of a button. We need to learn patience, live a life of gratitude. Keep the Almighty at the top of our priorities. So let’s get a perspective on our lives. May He continue to guide us!"
1422,2020-08-31 04:13:23+00:00,muftimenk,"We all struggle without a doubt; with our inner self, our mindset, society-led norms, procrastination, laziness, information overload etc. It’s an uphill task daily. Deal with the challenges; don’t let them get out of hand. Counter it with positivity, living life with a purpose!"
1423,2020-08-30 21:00:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Clear your doubts quickly. Else, it will fester and eat into your heart and mind. You’ll find yourself deeper in doubt. It’s not healthy because it can start chipping away your faith. Remember, none of us made it this far in our lives by ourselves. The Almighty protected us!"
1424,2020-08-30 10:40:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Change your priorities. Focus on that which matters. Not on other people's lives, their drama, problems &amp; behaviour. That’s not your business. You need to fix what needs fixing in your life. Don’t be distracted. Don’t compare your life to others. Circumstances are never the same!"
1425,2020-08-30 03:31:36+00:00,muftimenk,Your trials have a purpose. Nothing happens randomly. The Almighty has chosen them for you to learn valuable lessons. Use the opportunity to develop and grow. Don’t curse the problems. Embrace them. They will help you to move on to the next level of your development. Be grateful!
1426,2020-08-29 12:58:23+00:00,muftimenk,Having faith is a beautiful thing. It doesn’t mean you know what’s going on all the time. It doesn’t mean you have the answers to everything. It means you lay full trust in the Almighty who has all the solutions to your problems. He will unfold the plan when the time is right.
1427,2020-08-28 22:52:58+00:00,muftimenk,Do you get upset when the Almighty creates a detour on your journey? Do you question Him and ask the “whys and what ifs”? Always remember that He knows things which you and I don’t. Stay positive and trust that He will work it all our and the outcome will be for your own good!
1428,2020-08-28 12:01:32+00:00,muftimenk,There will be times in your life when nothing makes sense and you can’t see the wood for the trees. That’s when you need to keep trusting the Almighty and keep going. It won’t be easy but you have no other option. His plans for you are greater than you could ever imagine!
1429,2020-08-28 04:45:04+00:00,muftimenk,You’ll never always get exactly what you want in this world. You need to embrace the reality if you want to feel happy. Happiness will not come to those who are never grateful for the Almighty’s blessings; those who don’t appreciate what they already have. So be thankful!
1430,2020-08-27 19:08:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Sooner or later, people will let you down; no matter how good they are. This is human nature; we all make mistakes and poor decisions from time to time. Remember, you came into this world alone and you depart from it alone. So depend on no one but yourself &amp; the One who made you!"
1431,2020-08-27 10:41:03+00:00,muftimenk,Why are we always thinking about what can go wrong rather than what can go right? We seem to be experts in creating problems that weren’t even there in the first place. Simplify your thoughts. Use your time in the remembrance of the Almighty and above all think positive thoughts!
1432,2020-08-26 21:34:42+00:00,muftimenk,"To many, success is all about achievements &amp; material possessions. No! It’s how we use what the Almighty has bestowed on us to live a life of purpose, serving others &amp; spreading goodness. Whatever you do, don’t draw attention to yourself. Success is humble, not loud &amp; boisterous!"
1433,2020-08-26 14:18:54+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how badly you think you’ve sinned, it’s never too late to turn to the Almighty. He will give you second, third and more chances which humans won’t even dream of. He’s the most merciful. He’s waiting to forgive you and guide you. So what are you  waiting for?"
1434,2020-08-26 04:11:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Delays are good. Do not regard every delay as negative. There is  usually some hidden good &amp; blessing behind delays. But we with our limited knowledge, get upset when delayed; we just want things to happen like clockwork. They don’t in real life. The Almighty is in full control!"
1435,2020-08-25 23:51:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Always have good thoughts of the Almighty. You may feel hurt, wounded, broken or bitter but know that He’s aware of what you’re going through &amp; more. He will never abandon you. He will unfold ways to heal you. Your heart will be happy &amp; satisfied when you see what He has for you!"
1436,2020-08-25 11:01:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful who you allow into your life. Some will pretend to be friends when their true intention is to control you! So choose your friends carefully. If you grow resentful of people who take up too much of your time, it's a sign you aren't setting clear boundaries. Do it now!"
1437,2020-08-25 04:22:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you ever felt true inner peace despite the noise around you? Are you able to completely submit to the Almighty’s decree, knowing that your path has been planned for you? If yes, it shows that you firmly believe He wants only the best for you. Your heart’s in the right place!"
1438,2020-08-24 18:50:18+00:00,muftimenk,Supplication is one of the best cures for diseases of the heart. Communicate with your heart &amp; soul. Get close to the Almighty. He will grant comfort. Don’t search for happiness in a place where you will not find it. Know that true happiness comes from Him and it lasts forever.
1439,2020-08-24 05:30:24+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes the Almighty sends you blessings disguised in what you see as ugly packages. He wants to see your response. Will you give thanks &amp; embrace the whole process or judge it at face value &amp; react adversely to it? Don’t lose the plot. Don’t let Satan make you ungrateful!
1440,2020-08-23 20:47:58+00:00,muftimenk,The trials that come your way can make you better or bitter. They can make you grow up or give up. The Almighty’s watching your response. Have you got what it takes to go through tough trials? Will you bear good patience with a soft heart or will your heart harden in the process?
1441,2020-08-23 14:32:37+00:00,muftimenk,Do you keep going round in circles? Do you feel like you’re moving but not making any progress? Then you have to stop doing what you’re doing &amp; take stock of your life. Reevaluate your priorities &amp; shift your mindset. Get out of the rut. Seek your strength from the Almighty.
1442,2020-08-23 04:34:13+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let your fears and worries crush you. Never feel alone in your internal panic. The Almighty knows every single thing about you. Keep asking Him. Keep confiding in Him. Let go of the worry that’s gripping you. Let Him take over and feel a sense of calm restored in you!
1443,2020-08-22 21:58:58+00:00,muftimenk,"What is this life but a series of obstacles? The good news is nothing happens without the Almighty’s Will. If anything unpleasant comes into your life, it had to get approval from Him. He knows the kind of test you need. He’s placed a blessing inside of it. It’s for your good!"
1444,2020-08-22 11:32:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Life can be difficult if all you see is everything that’s wrong. Start focusing on what’s right, what’s good, what’s constructive. No matter what you’re facing, if you choose a positive mindset, you’ll emerge the winner. So if you want to feel better, you’ve got to think better!"
1445,2020-08-22 04:18:04+00:00,muftimenk,Stop investing in your past. It’s over. Let it go. The Almighty has paved a way for you to move forward. Don’t be so engrossed with what was &amp; what has been that you forget to acknowledge His Blessing for what is &amp; what’s to come. Read the signs &amp; make that change to your life!
1446,2020-08-21 21:50:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to be at peace with what the Almighty has chosen for you. If we allow that peace to reign in our hearts, our worldly stresses will dissipate &amp; disappear. Don’t allow unanswered prayers for the moment to cause anger or bitterness. He has the best answer &amp; solution always!"
1447,2020-08-21 14:06:32+00:00,muftimenk,Are you always unhappy &amp; discontented with life? If you are check yourself for these symptoms. Are you always criticising others; complaining that your life isn’t good enough; quick to condemn people or comparing yourself with your neighbours? Stop all that &amp; feel the difference!
1448,2020-08-21 04:24:30+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant us tranquility &amp; hope in this pandemic that seems far from over. Many are confused &amp; helpless as nations go back into lockdown. Keep us thankful always as many are suffering a lot more than us. We ask You for beautiful patience to endure what lies ahead. Aameen!
1449,2020-08-20 22:44:48+00:00,muftimenk,Alimighty. Help us get rid of jealousy &amp; envy from our hearts. They’re the cause of many of today’s woes. Help us understand that envy eats &amp; rots the heart. Forgive us when we grumble how You bless others. Help us avoid comparison &amp; learn to be at peace with Your Blessings.
1450,2020-08-20 14:12:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Anger is a choice. We can choose to retreat into our own minds and calm down or we can explode. Anger takes a lot of energy. Fighting, using derogatory words and showing acts of violence don’t solve any problem. Instead, take a step back, rationalise and seek the Almighty’s help!"
1451,2020-08-19 22:17:15+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have a grateful heart, you have everything. You acknowledge the goodness in your life. The Almighty will grant you more. He will increase your sustenance; ease your affairs; open doors you never thought possible. He will make you feel abundant rather than deprived!"
1452,2020-08-19 08:58:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t expect everyone to react the way you do when confronted with a difficult situation. Remember, we have all been brought up differently and have different life experiences. This will determine our reaction to various situations. So be kind always and remember we all struggle!"
1453,2020-08-18 22:29:44+00:00,muftimenk,We are humans and we are prone to mistakes and sins. Never mind how many times you’ve sinned but the biggest mistake is to lose hope in the Almighty’s Mercy. Keep repenting. Keep turning back to Him. Always believe that He will forgive you. This is what sets us apart from Satan!
1454,2020-08-18 14:29:51+00:00,muftimenk,"People expect instant miracles everyday. Not everything in life is like that. You have to go through a process. We have become impatient when supplicating, expecting instant response. The Almighty doesn’t work like that. We need to learn patience, live a life of gratitude."
1455,2020-08-18 07:44:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Avoid suspicion. It’s a trait of Satan and detested by the Almighty. It stems from a heart that is insecure and always full of doubt. At its worst, it can turn into hate; harming people and destroying relationships. Counter it with optimism, positive thoughts and firm faith!"
1456,2020-08-17 22:25:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is indeed a journey. Successful is he who can navigate the ups and downs without losing his balance. Don’t dwell on your past, don’t wallow in self-pity, don’t repeat your mistakes, don’t focus on negativity, help others along the way, spread kindness wherever you go!"
1457,2020-08-17 12:03:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Do good, even what you consider to be insignificant acts. The Almighty sees, hears &amp; knows everything. He will reward you for it. Remember unlike humans, He’s above glitches, errors &amp; system failures. He is perfect but He doesn’t expect perfection from us. Only sincere effort!"
1458,2020-08-16 22:05:24+00:00,muftimenk,Do you have scars to show? They are proof of inner strength. They show us that we’re all warriors really; even if we were gasping for air for a while. Scars show what we’ve been through &amp; how strong we are for coming out of it because the Almighty chose to restore us! Thank Him!
1459,2020-08-16 13:42:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit procrastinating. Stop putting things off. So often in life, we feel like we can delay things &amp; do them much later. But we may never have the same opportunities again. This life is so transient. Here today, gone tomorrow. You’ve seen that happen. So best to do it now!"
1460,2020-08-16 06:24:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone wrongs you, instead of retaliating, learn to respond with kindness &amp; patience. It’s possible if you set your heart &amp; mind to it. If the Almighty is gracious to you why can’t you do the same to others? Be compassionate. No one knows what others are going through."
1461,2020-08-15 14:00:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Every now and then, life will throw you a curveball when you least expect it. The Almighty sends them to disrupt your daily, comfortable routine. They’re a blessing in disguise. You’ll eventually realize. He’s watching to see if you’ve got what it takes to pull through!"
1462,2020-08-15 04:43:56+00:00,muftimenk,"We don’t deny that money is important. But you don’t have to go crazy over it. The Almighty has written it down for you, there’s no need for you to lie, cheat, deceive, resort to fraudulent practices, abuse the rights of others just to make some extra bucks. Greed doesn’t pay!"
1463,2020-08-14 16:59:08+00:00,muftimenk,Stop complaining &amp; start living. It has been a disruptive year with most of our plans put on the back burner but understand that our lives have changed &amp; we won’t be going back to what it was before the pandemic. Be thankful for what you have &amp; keep moving forward. #newnormal
1464,2020-08-14 10:53:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Lower your expectations of others or better still, have zero expectations. That way you’re less likely to get hurt or disappointed. Rely on none other than the One who made you. Ask from none other than Him. Keep asking. Pray. Your prayers can’t be answered if you don’t pray!"
1465,2020-08-14 04:24:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Amid these uncertain times, we thank You for the challenges &amp; struggles; they’ve  brought us closer to You. Amid the darkness, we see Your light; in our fear, we feel Your strength. We pray for compassion &amp; love for others. Keep our hearts attached to You. Aameen!"
1466,2020-08-13 12:07:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t rush things in life. The Almighty loves  patience. He makes everything beautiful in His timing, which is always the best. If He’s making you wait, there’s a reason. Don’t let Satan tempt you into believing that the Almighty’s not listening to your calls. He always listens!"
1467,2020-08-13 04:35:06+00:00,muftimenk,"If the Almighty wants you to do something, He will give you the ability to carry it out to the best of your ability. Keep believing in yourself and keep Him in focus. Keep your head down and cut out distractions from your life. He will guide you. That’s how you will succeed!"
1468,2020-08-12 20:38:59+00:00,muftimenk,"You can choose to either let fear paralyze you or allow your faith to take over &amp; let the Almighty guide you. It can be a daunting task when you don’t know what’s going on but if you trust Him, He can make the impossible a reality. That’s His job. Learn to move forward by faith!"
1469,2020-08-12 05:03:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you sincerely repented? When you regret the sins you’ve committed, feel sad for having committed them &amp; feel pain when you remember them, these are signs of sincere repentance. But after this, Satan will cause you to doubt the Almighty’s Mercy. Don’t fall for it!"
1470,2020-08-11 21:16:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. No matter how many trials You send our way, let us not feel helpless or give up hope because we know You have our backs always. Help us to realise that You’re our source of peace and we will never be able to attain true peace of mind without You in our lives!"
1471,2020-08-11 15:32:29+00:00,muftimenk,"If you get back to basics, life is really not that complicated. Try to keep it simple. Stay true to who you are. Don't worry about what other people think of you. They will always have an opinion. Just do your best. Surround yourself with good people. Settle for nothing less!"
1472,2020-08-11 04:20:43+00:00,muftimenk,"People will usually show their true colours when you’re in need of help or facing some crisis. Remember, fair-weather friends are aplenty. They hang around you in good times. Their true nature is never shown or disclosed until times of trouble. You’ll know your true friends then!"
1473,2020-08-10 18:06:07+00:00,muftimenk,"You may be penniless, homeless, unemployed, sick and feel like you have nothing. But you have the one thing that money can't buy: the Almighty. He knows what you want, what you need, what you deserve, at what time &amp; place, trust Him &amp; His decisions. He knows while you don't."

1475,2020-08-10 04:30:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you guilty of this? Always criticizing others because you’re impatient? You don’t tolerate those who behave differently. You expect people to behave like you. When we focus on someone else’s flaw, we stop seeing the person. We just see their mistakes. Stop this bad habit!"
1476,2020-08-09 12:17:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Disengage yourself when you find that you’re in the company of those who love to gossip. It may be hard to get out of it but you must. You don’t want to be a bad listener, but always remember, you’re not accountable for their words. Instead, you’ll be taken to task for yours!"
1477,2020-08-09 04:45:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Breathe a huge sigh of relief &amp;  smile at what the Almighty has blessed you with. Remember, it could always be worse. Learn to look at those who have less than you. That way you will never undervalue His blessings. And when you appreciate what you have, He gives you more!"
1478,2020-08-08 13:58:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Letting go is incredibly difficult. Some find it hard to move on, clinging on to their past. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Life is all about change. No matter how hard we try to keep things as they are, change will come eventually. So let go when you know you have to!"
1479,2020-08-08 04:22:53+00:00,muftimenk,"We take tomorrow for granted because we believe tomorrow will always be there. Yes, tomorrow may be there, but remember, we may not! Who said ""tomorrow"" is guaranteed? Make the most of ""today"" that you are blessed with! Yesterday, many thought that they would see today!"
1480,2020-08-07 16:58:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Maybe the Almighty’s teaching you how to wait because He wants you to know that you can’t actually control your life no matter how hard you try. You may think you’re holding the reins but the truth is you’re not because that’s His job, not yours. Lest you forget!"
1481,2020-08-07 10:02:40+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We pray for healing. The world seems to be spiraling out of control. There’s widespread mayhem. We even see chaos in our own lives.There are days where we feel demoralized. You're the only One who can lift our spirits &amp; will truly listen. You have all the answers!
1482,2020-08-07 04:34:27+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We pray for ease amidst all the suffering going on in the world today. May You comfort every heart that’s experiencing the heaviness of loss. Only You can heal the brokenness and void left by loved ones gone. It’s a very trying period for many. Grant us utmost patience!
1483,2020-08-06 22:22:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Never doubt that whatever trial  the Almighty sends your way, you’ll be able to handle it. He will never ask you to do something that you can’t do. He will never test you beyond your capabilities. You are fully equipped, qualified, and capable to face the trials. Trust Him!"
1484,2020-08-06 12:13:03+00:00,muftimenk,Why do you resent other people’s success? The trouble is social media makes it worse. You believe that everyone else is happier &amp; wealthier as you view their posts. Stop comparing yourself to others. Reframe your mindest. your job is to do your best with what you’ve been given!
1485,2020-08-06 05:01:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes the hardest person to correct is yourself. There is no shame in being wrong. We are human and we make mistakes. The shame is in choosing to stay on the wrong path. Make that change, as difficult as you think it is. Take that first step; get back on track!"
1486,2020-08-05 22:54:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Listen to your instincts. Depending on the state of your piety &amp; heart, they can be your moral compass. If you keep purifying your heart, the Almighty will send you a light to distinguish between truth &amp; falsehood, right &amp; wrong. So pay attention to your gut feel &amp; sixth sense!"
1487,2020-08-05 06:45:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Good and bad days exist in this journey called life. One day you feel broken, the next day you feel whole. It’s all part of the Almighty’s Plan. It’s teaching us to lay complete trust in Him. Remember, we walk by faith. He will not allow us to break, He will carry us through!"
1488,2020-08-04 22:29:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Heartbreaking, devastating, tragic, horrific scenes from #Beirut. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with #Lebanon today. The sheer magnitude of the #BeirutExplosions! Almighty, help them overcome such a difficult time. We seek Your Mercy and strength!  #BeirutBlasts"
1489,2020-08-04 18:07:08+00:00,muftimenk,"We sin &amp; make mistakes daily. Everyone who makes a mistake deserves another chance; we’re human enough to make a mistake. Therefore, everyone deserves another chance. Imagine, if the Almighty accepts our repentance &amp; is willing to forgive, shouldn’t we do the same for others?"
1490,2020-08-04 04:31:50+00:00,muftimenk,"When making tough decisions in life, always be sure you’ll be pleasing the Almighty and not incurring His wrath. That way, you’ll always find yourself guided because at the end of the day, the final judgement is up to Him alone. Don’t worry what people will think or say!"
1491,2020-08-03 20:29:50+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how much you regret it or worry about what happened, the past is over. You can’t change a thing. But you can come to terms with the fact that everything happens for a reason. Live in the present where the Almighty has given you the options to restore calm to your heart!"

1493,2020-08-03 13:04:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Intentions play a huge role in our faith. You’ll be rewarded according to your intent. For a “pure” goal, like your deeds to be valid, the intent of the believer must be untainted; free of egoistic self-interest. Otherwise, this outward good deed is pointless with the Almighty!"
1494,2020-08-03 04:30:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t hate the experience that shaped you. It’s what the Almighty wants for you. That’s why He sends specific tests to each &amp; everyone of us. Everything happens for a reason. You may think it was a painful experience but if you bear patience, you’ll emerge a much stronger person!"
1495,2020-08-02 22:39:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Are your thoughts and conversation always focusing on people; what’s going on in their lives, their relationships, their social status etc. If your answer is yes, then you have a serious problem. You need to get out of that mould; focus on yourself rather than others."
1496,2020-08-02 12:20:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you verified what you posted? Be careful not to post unverified news or suspicions on social media. Unwittingly, you may be responsible for causing problems and grief in people’s lives. You may also be fanning flames of social unrest. The results can be devastating!"
1497,2020-08-02 06:39:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you ever felt like giving up because the road is too long? Do you feel discouraged &amp; overwhelmed because there’s hard work to be done? Don’t be. Remember, you’re never alone in your journey. The Almighty is with you. Should you trip &amp; fall, shake off the dust &amp; carry on!"
1498,2020-08-01 16:27:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t shrink back the minute calamity strikes. Difficulties and challenges are part of life. Stay strong and have firm faith that the Almighty wants something new for you. Perhaps you’ve been stuck in a rut for a while. Whatever it is, embrace it. Remember, hardship makes a man!"
1499,2020-08-01 04:56:53+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s so much strife and suffering in the world right now. Don’t give up hope. Keep praying. Keep supplicating. The Almighty is in control. Remember, He has tested those before us with much more. So bear good patience. It’s darkest before dawn. That streak of light WILL appear!"
1500,2020-07-31 21:51:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to walk away from people and situations that threaten your peace of mind, self-respect, values, morals or self- worth. Don’t argue with them. Don’t get into a debate with them. It’s not worth your effort. It’s also a sign of maturity to stay away from such incidents!"
1501,2020-07-31 16:12:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is short. Instead of quibbling over petty issues, make it a point to touch lives &amp; hearts whenever you get the opportunity. Give, forgive &amp; apologise. If you find difficulty doing it, make a commitment &amp; start on this day of Eid. Channel your energy to things that matter."
1502,2020-07-31 09:20:12+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Accept our good deeds &amp; acts of sacrifice. Wipe away our sins &amp; forgive our shortcomings on this Day of Sacrifice. Grant us patience as we face a different world due to the pandemic. Only You know what lies ahead. Keep our hearts light as we entrust our affairs to You!

1505,2020-07-30 21:38:18+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty knows things which you and I don’t. He pays attention. He’s aware who is talking about you behind your back, who is trying to bring you down. Why worry? You stand to gain a lot of good deeds on Judgement Day from those who have discredited you. Keep doing your best!"
1506,2020-07-30 12:45:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Make this blessed day of #Arafah, a day of renewal of our faith in our heart &amp; actions, a day of repentance &amp; day to get closer to You. Forgive our sins, those which we commit knowingly &amp; the ones we commit out of ignorance. May we never lose hope in Your Mercy! Aameen!"

1508,2020-07-29 14:33:59+00:00,muftimenk,Do something pleasing to the Almighty today! Give up something for His sake. Experience the true meaning of sacrifice. Do it sincerely with full submission. It will strengthen our faith. May we achieve the benefits of these days.May He accept the sincere efforts of those on Hajj.
1509,2020-07-29 05:02:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you ever stopped to think that the news you’re spreading about someone might not be true? Slander is dangerous. Don’t engage in such acts. Remember, if you hear something false or dubious about someone, defend him. The Almighty will defend you in this world &amp; the next."
1510,2020-07-28 22:18:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Start by fixing yourself. To do that you need to acknowledge the problem, tackle it head on &amp; resolve the issues within yourself. Aim to be a better version of you &amp; work on it. Shift the focus to yourself. The Almighty will guide you step by step."
1511,2020-07-28 14:54:05+00:00,muftimenk,We may not have control over everything that happens in our lives but we do get to choose how we respond to things. Worry is a choice. Happy is a choice. It’s all about your attitude and how you wish to view the world. The choice is yours!
1512,2020-07-28 06:16:23+00:00,muftimenk,"You can’t run away from your problems. That’s right. You can’t. The Almighty has sent it to you for a purpose. You need to accept it, get to the root of it &amp; solve it. He’s there to guide you if you seek Him. He’s waiting to see how you respond. He wants to elevate your status!"
1513,2020-07-27 22:28:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Take time for self-reflection and introspection. Do it for self-development. But the truth is we’re too busy &amp; when we’re not, we’d rather be analysing people’s lives based on what we see on social media. Remember, we don’t learn from experience but from reflecting on them!"
1514,2020-07-27 13:44:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything that happens in your life is preparing you for the next stage. Nothing happens by chance. Everything has been carefully crafted by the Master Planner. Your Creator. It won’t be a bed of roses but if you trust Him, He will guide you to move forward, one step at a time!"
1515,2020-07-27 05:28:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Every time you think you’ve  reached a dead end, remember that when you see a wall, the Almighty sees a way; an opportunity. Your faith should keep you going. It tells you that no matter what lies ahead, the Almighty is there to clear the path for you. You have to trust Him!"
1516,2020-07-26 22:58:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you this person? A mature one with a special heart who says that no matter how much someone hurts me, I'll still pray for him. It’s not easy. Most of us will actually do the reverse; start cursing &amp; swearing the person when this happens. But such people do exist. Respect!"
1517,2020-07-26 12:26:37+00:00,muftimenk,Use your mouths for good or bad. The choice is yours. Our words can help if used wisely or they can hurt. Choose to speak kind words that motivate &amp; give hope &amp; encouragement. Speak words of praise &amp; keep the Almighty in focus always. Just don’t use your words to complain &amp; harm!
1518,2020-07-26 05:36:50+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what you’re going through, always remember that the Almighty is in full control. He reminds you and shows you His Prowess by putting you in situations which you can’t control. So bear good patience and accept His Decree knowing that everything will come to pass!"
1519,2020-07-25 20:50:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of this trap. It happens to those who want to please everyone around them. They become people-pleasers and do it with such fervour, often jeopardizing their link with the Almighty. Don’t! It’s not worth it. Know your priorities. Protect yourself at all costs!"
1520,2020-07-25 11:37:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be mean to people. You really don’t want to hurt them in such a way that they complain to the Almighty, raise their hands to the Lord of the heavens and seek help from Him. That’s why it’s important to quickly seek forgiveness once you’ve wronged someone. Don’t delay it!"

1524,2020-07-24 21:03:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you content with life? Being content is different form being happy. Happiness doesn’t last; it comes &amp; goes, it’s mainly from the outside. Contentment comes from a deeper place. You’re at peace with what the Almighty has bestowed on you, no matter what your circumstances!"
1525,2020-07-24 14:04:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We pray for peace in our hearts. Although we’re not able to carry out the Hajj this year because of the pandemic, we ask You to protect the chosen ones who are on their pilgrimage this year. We ask you to facilitate their journey &amp; keep them safe. Aameen!"
1526,2020-07-24 04:02:32+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to renew our hearts with strength and purpose on this day. Forgive our past sins and help us get closer to You. We know You have our backs and have brought us this far. Guide us always for we can't make it by ourselves!
1527,2020-07-23 16:01:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Guard your thoughts at all costs. Don’t let anyone mess with your mind. You become what you constantly think about. If you think you can’t, you probably won’t make it. If you think you’re a failure, you’ll end miserable; feeling sorry for yourself. You won’t get much out of life!"

Your prayers may be delayed but they’re never rejected. The best people often had difficult beginnings. But with patience &amp; good attitude, they have the best ending!"
1530,2020-07-22 22:26:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Never tire of doing good, even small acts. We often hear people say that no one notices any of the good they do! But the Almighty does. He’s All-Knowing! So press on &amp; do as much as you can, knowing the ten best days are upon us. Good deeds are magnified &amp; the rewards multiplied!"
1531,2020-07-22 15:57:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste the #mostblesseddays. Ten days is not a long time so be sure to fill your days with as much good as possible.

So what should you do? Restart, refocus, realllign, readjust your plans. Do it as often as you need to. Press on. Just don’t quit!"
1533,2020-07-21 22:07:58+00:00,muftimenk,"You might think the battle is too big for you. You’re overwhelmed by the cares &amp; stresses of life but remember, it’s nothing to the Lord of the Worlds. Nothing is impossible for Him. Hand it over to Him &amp; see how things unfold. He will take care of all that we cannot! Have faith!"
1534,2020-07-21 11:49:08+00:00,muftimenk,One of our biggest flaws is pretending to be blind to our own shortcomings but we’re the first to jump down someone's throat when they make a mistake. Let’s change that. Learn to be more self-critical instead of always pointing fingers at others. Always start with yourself!
1535,2020-07-21 04:39:08+00:00,muftimenk,"The choices you make are yours. You don’t need to explain yourself to anyone. But a lot of us feel this need to explain ourselves. Perhaps we want to be liked by everyone. Or to fit in with them. Whatever it is, stick to your decisions. If you think you’re wrong, correct them!"
1536,2020-07-20 18:31:41+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have problems sleeping at night or suffer from insomnia, use that time to get close to the Almighty in one of the most blessed of prayers. Don’t waste time on social media or gaming. You need to recognize that your sleeplessness is a gift from Him. Not everyone gets it!"
1537,2020-07-20 08:19:12+00:00,muftimenk,One of our biggest flaws is pretending to be blind to our own shortcomings but we’re the first to jump down someone's throat when they make a mistake. Let’s change that. Learn to be more self-critical instead of always pointing fingers at others. Always start with yourself!
1538,2020-07-19 23:19:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you find yourself getting more impatient? The truth is social media makes us impatient. It rushes us to want what others have, to be the person you see on your timeline, to live someone else’s life. Learn to be content with what you have. Appreciate the person that you are."
1539,2020-07-19 16:01:11+00:00,muftimenk,"When facing a trial, remember that the Almighty’s constantly trying to refine us out of His Love &amp; Mercy so that we can attain the highest ranks in Paradise. So quit asking “why me” when a calamity strikes. Face it with a good attitude so you don’t end up frustrated &amp; bitter!"
1540,2020-07-19 07:52:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever happens in life, keep going. Quitting is NOT an option because quitting is permanent. Setbacks and disappointments are not. They should serve to challenge and motivate you to strive even harder. The rewards are sweeter. Once you give up, that’s the end of the story!"
1541,2020-07-18 18:49:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you carrying emotional baggage from your past? Remember, it can destroy you if you allow it. The state of your mind is important. If you fill it with hurt, anger, pain, revenge and regrets, it doesn’t augur  well for your future. Shift your focus. Make a fresh start today."
1542,2020-07-18 08:52:15+00:00,muftimenk,"We can all learn to listen more. It sounds simple but listening is a skill, an art &amp; a discipline. Pay attention to what people say. Listen to the words. It’s coming from the heart. The mouth will reveal what the heart feels. Listening can save you from a whole lot of trouble!"
1543,2020-07-17 20:20:26+00:00,muftimenk,"What goes around comes around &amp; sometimes the lesson is much harder than what you had expected. You reap what you sow tells you that whatever you do in life surely gets counted. Yes they do. So remember this; no matter how much life gets unfair sometimes, it cannot be unjust."
1544,2020-07-17 13:58:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Only You know the hardships &amp; pain we’re going through. We hand over our worries to You as we’ve done before. If not for You, we wouldn’t be here right now. We ask You to bless those who’ve lost their way. Lead them back to Your Path. We’re thankful for Your Mercy!"
1545,2020-07-17 04:35:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. More than six months on and the pandemic is still with us. Many are prone to fear, anxiety and even despair. We pray for healing for those who are ill. Protect those who are most at risk. Give comfort to those who’ve lost loved ones. We place our total trust in You."
1546,2020-07-16 19:47:10+00:00,muftimenk,Stop jumping to conclusions. Things aren’t always what they seem. Don’t be too quick to form an impression. You perceive people who don’t mean to hurt you as having evil intent. This could affect your mental health in the long term. So do yourself a favour. Think good thoughts!
1547,2020-07-16 12:15:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware toxic people. They come in many forms. When they can no longer control you, they will devise plans and manipulate how others see you. You’ll feel victimised but try and stay above the fray. Keep your cool. The truth will eventually out. The Almighty will see to it anyway!"
1548,2020-07-16 06:22:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to detach yourself. From things, events and basically anything that robs you of your peace of mind. Most things worldly fit into this category. Remember, you don’t need to understand why everything happened the way it did. Let it go and let the Almighty take over!"
1549,2020-07-15 20:23:33+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re facing test after test and you’re at a breaking point. Hold on. Remember, a test can sometimes replace a worse misfortune or it could be a form of protection from something. Take your tests in your stride, knowing the Almighty wants only good for you!"
1550,2020-07-15 09:32:35+00:00,muftimenk,"The closer you try to get to the Almighty, the harder Satan will work to steer you away. His mission is to create confusion, fear; anxiety &amp; panic over things you can't control. It’s all part of his plan. You need to be aware. Don’t let your guard down; not even for a second!"
1551,2020-07-14 14:30:48+00:00,muftimenk,"We’re all experts in people’s lives. Social media has made us such! We claim to know everything about others based on what they post online &amp; what we hear. What we don’t know, we fabricate. We embellish. We forget we’ll have to account for everything on Judgement Day! Beware!"
1552,2020-07-14 04:32:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware of cancel culture. It happens when a celebrity or public figure is said to have done or uttered something offensive. A public backlash, often fueled by social media follows. Then the calls to cancel the person; to end their career.  Don’t be rash &amp; act without evidence!"
1553,2020-07-13 20:28:37+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re getting anxious &amp; having doubts, wondering if the Almighty hears your supplications. You forget that He knows what’s in your heart. He knows what you want even before you asked Him. Yet, He listens to every word, every plea that you utter. So keep asking. He’s All-Hearing!"
1554,2020-07-13 14:01:16+00:00,muftimenk,"When you find yourself in a certain situation which you never expected, don’t ask why. Accept it as part of the Almighty’s Plan. Keep your focus. Keep going. The Almighty knows what’s best for you even if you find it unpalatable. Looking back, you’ll be grateful it happened!"
1555,2020-07-13 05:14:57+00:00,muftimenk,Spread this far and wide. Someone else’s success doesn’t equate your failure! Let’s break this ugly cycle and remember that the Almighty rewards each and everyone of us differently. Start being genuinely happy for others. Learn to cheer them on. Your turn will come!
1556,2020-07-13 00:04:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Friends come and go, some leave footprints in your life while others leave unspeakable scars. Remember, a friend who tries to please everyone is a friend to none. They’ll keep mum when you’re wrongfully accused &amp; most definitely not be on your side when the time comes! Beware!"
1557,2020-07-12 14:52:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop hating your body. Start  living life. Don’t believe what you see on social media that’s been doctored, filtered, photoshopped. What you consider flaws are celebrated by others. Your body’s a gift from the Almighty. He’s made you in the best form. So take good care of it!"
1558,2020-07-12 04:48:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Replace fear with faith. Worry with worship. Panic with peace. Always remember that the Almighty is totally in control. Surrender your insecurities, your nagging doubts and innermost fears to Him. He will set them right for you and your heart will find tranquility once again."
1559,2020-07-11 22:22:46+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll be content if you make this your life motto. If you’re below others, push them up. If they are by your side, guide them along. If you’re above them, reach out &amp; give them a leg up. It’s not easy. It requires a sincere heart. You’ll attract so much goodness into your life!"
1560,2020-07-11 16:32:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Why do we always have to focus on what’s wrong, what’s bad, what’s lacking? Can we for a change, focus on the beauty that exists in the world even during these challenging times? Perhaps that’s why the Almighty made us all stay home to reflect on the blessings we have!"
1561,2020-07-11 08:03:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Understand the Almighty’s Plan. If you’ve done your best &amp; things still don’t work out, move on. Know that He has something better for you. You may not be able to see it at that point in time, but that’s when you need firm faith. Better things and better days are ahead. Trust!"
1562,2020-07-10 23:35:33+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s natural to fear the unknown. As humans, we don’t have the answers to everything, but we must trust that the Almighty has planned our next step. Always remember that He who has brought us this far, will see us through every difficulty that comes our way!"
1563,2020-07-10 12:58:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you determine your worth by the size of your bank balance? Nothing material will bring you what you’re looking for. If you want a life of abundance, start with gratitude. Always be thankful. Find it in your heart to be happy for others. You’ll attract a lot more blessings!"
1564,2020-07-10 04:54:05+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Calm our troubled hearts and let peace and tranquility reign once again. There’s so much noise and confusion around us that it’s easy to be distracted and lose focus. Many useless things demand our attention. Guide us. Keep us firm in faith; always close to You! Aameen!
1565,2020-07-09 16:45:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Do your best to always use the best words when speaking to others &amp; not to resort to insults, name-calling &amp; harshness. This is even more important in the age of the internet! Today, many don’t give a second thought to what they say &amp; write! Remember you’ll be held accountable!"
1566,2020-07-09 08:07:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let sadness consume you. What's this life but a mixture of sad &amp; happy moments. Nothing lasts. That’s how it is. No matter what the Almighty places in your path, keep putting one foot in front of the other, even when it hurts. Trust that He only wants what’s good for you!"
1567,2020-07-08 19:34:36+00:00,muftimenk,Trials are a gift from the Almighty. The hardship you’re experiencing might just be what earns His Pleasure. It might just be your ticket to Paradise. He’s watching to see if it softens your hardened heart; if it makes you admit He is the source of everything. He is in control.
1568,2020-07-08 13:34:35+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is we’re being favoured daily. The Almighty bestows His many blessings on us in various forms but often we don’t see them. The closed doors He’s protecting us from, opening new doors &amp; opportunities, the new people He brings forth or removes from our lives. Thank Him!"
1569,2020-07-08 04:58:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t beat yourself over something that happened in the past. Repent, seek forgiveness, move on. We all sin; we all make mistakes. But the best are those who learn from their shortcomings, focus on becoming a better version of themselves, leaving no time for futile activities!"
1570,2020-07-07 21:59:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty takes something away from you, do you wallow in self-pity, thinking negative thoughts or do you have firm belief that He will replace it with something better? If you understood His Plan, you’ll be ever hopeful what’s to come will be better than what’s gone!"
1571,2020-07-07 12:17:51+00:00,muftimenk,"How do we react when we’re really upset; when it feels like our world has exploded? Acknowledge the feeling but don’t let it get out of control. Ignoring your feelings won’t make them go away, it just prolongs the healing process. Confide in the Almighty who controls everything!"
1572,2020-07-07 05:27:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of the people you allow into your inner circle. Make sure you’re familiar with every one of them. Make sure the people in your boat are rowing in the same direction as you are. Remember, it’s better to be alone than to be with those who’ll jeopardise your Hereafter!"
1573,2020-07-06 19:30:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through, know that nothing is too big for the Lord of the Worlds. There’s no promise He can’t fulfill, no prayer He can’t answer, no obstacle He can’t remove, no heart He can’t mend, no illness He can’t heal &amp; the list goes on! Stay encouraged; stay focused!"
1574,2020-07-06 11:05:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Growth is usually uncomfortable. It’s human nature to resist it because it takes you out of your comfort zone to a different version of yourself. So don’t be so hard on yourself. Cut yourself some slack, say a prayer. You’ll get there sooner or later if you set your mind to it!"
1575,2020-07-06 04:49:47+00:00,muftimenk,Trust the Almighty to remove certain people from your life because they no longer serve a purpose. Accept it and allow Him to bring in new people into your life for the next stage of your growth. It may seem daunting but He knows what He’s doing. It’s your leap of faith!
1576,2020-07-05 17:36:26+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste your time confiding in others e when you have a problem. It’s been shown most don’t care. The rest wished you had it worse &amp; only a small number feel sorry! Turn to the Almighty who is always there for you. He’s the Best Listener. What more do you need!
1577,2020-07-05 03:31:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus on where you’re headed. Where you’ve been is the past. Don’t waste your energy reliving those times. There’s a reason the Almighty has brought you to where you are right now. Remember, sometimes those with the worst past have created the best future! Don’t lose hope!"
1578,2020-07-04 18:41:48+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will bring you what you need. Don’t doubt that. Turn to Him. Cry. Beg. Ask for guidance, understanding, relief, forgiveness etc. Never underestimate the power of repeating your supplications with beautiful patience. Keep asking with full hope &amp; you shall receive!"
1579,2020-07-04 05:05:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When you appreciate yourself, it becomes easier to appreciate others. When you lack self-acceptance, that’s when you have enemies. How else can you accept other people’s uniqueness if you can’t honour yours. Be true to yourself. Your journey is yours alone. Don’t imitate others!"
1580,2020-07-03 17:40:50+00:00,muftimenk,"You are what you focus on. What thoughts do you entertain in your head? What you allow to grow there will be your centre of focus. If you think positive thoughts, you’ll attract positivity into your life. That’s how it works. Don’t let negativity creep in! Do it consciously!"
1581,2020-07-03 12:02:50+00:00,muftimenk,"@TeamKhabib Brother Khabib. Our deepest sympathies &amp; condolences to you and your family upon the passing away of your father &amp; coach. May Allah Almighty grant him forgiveness &amp; paradise! Aameen
إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون. اللهم اغفر له وارحمه وسكنه في الجنة"
1582,2020-07-03 11:33:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Never underestimate the impact you have on those around you. The smile you gave, the helping hand you extended, the words of encouragement, that pat on the back etc. You don’t need a reason to be kind. Don’t wait. Just do it. Be guided by your heart, you’ll know when it’s right"
1583,2020-07-03 04:46:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. You are our refuge &amp; strength. We place our trust in You especially during these tumultuous times. There’s so much violence, terror &amp; political upheaval. We turn to You for  courage &amp; hope. We need peace badly. Peace in the world &amp; peace in the hearts of people. Aameen!"
1584,2020-07-02 20:52:40+00:00,muftimenk,Everything has a beginning &amp; an end. So why do we constantly stress over the state that we are in? There’s light at the end of the tunnel. The storm won’t last. The heart will love again. You’ll be amazed at what will come your way! Just ask the Almighty! The Eternal.
1585,2020-07-02 14:23:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Even during your darkest days, don’t neglect the Almighty. You may think your situation is so complicated, there’s no solution; but the truth is the Almighty’s watching you. He wants to see how much you truly need Him. He will respond even to a silent prayer of a heart in need!"
1586,2020-07-02 05:25:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let your heartache consume you. Even when your pain felt like it would never go away. Just raise hands &amp; cry out to the Almighty. Begging. Never doubt that He will respond. He will answer you immediately or when you least expect it. But remember, none of the pain will last!"
1587,2020-07-01 21:50:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Feeling lost and hopeless, bobbing on a boat in the middle of the sea. No sight of land. Feeling anxious not knowing what tomorrow holds. Feeling stuck when every move you make brings you to a dead end! Know that the help of the Almighty is near. Very near. Patience. Trust."
1588,2020-07-01 06:16:59+00:00,muftimenk,"When a person turns away from the Almighty, another ten or more turn towards Him. The loss is never His but ours! Don't let yourself be replaced by others. Don't let your name be registered on the wrong side. It's not too late for a comeback. Turn towards Him &amp; remain steadfast."
1589,2020-06-30 21:56:44+00:00,muftimenk,"If you've gained a million likes by posting something disliked by the Almighty then you've lost! Leave a legacy you’ll be proud of on the Day you meet your Maker! Be responsible. Avoid anything immoral or sinful. If you can’t be responsible, then it's time to uninstall some apps."
1590,2020-06-30 18:01:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Do yourself a favour. If you’re doing something to show off, don’t do it. It’s futile really. You might bask in momentary glory and people will admite you etc but honestly, it means nothing to the Almighty! It’s His validation that you need. That’s the only thing that matters!"
1591,2020-06-30 04:16:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Never doubt that the Almighty knows how tired your heart &amp; soul are. So cry if you must. Weep your heart out if you must.  Take time out if you must. And when all is said and done, get up and walk again with courage. Stand firm knowing that He is always with you. Keep going!"
1592,2020-06-29 22:58:34+00:00,muftimenk,Let’s face it. You will meet people who have the ability to bring out the worst in you. They may provoke you to say things you regret or pressure you to do things you wouldn't normally do. So stay true to your values and refuse to let others have a negative influence over you!
1593,2020-06-29 16:37:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Surely we have enough of our own faults, leaving no time to look at others. And never judge people by their past. Why? Because people learn from their mistakes. People change. People move on. So don’t be stuck in your mindest &amp; label people based on what you used to know of them!"
1594,2020-06-29 04:18:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Take constructive criticism in your stride. Often, in the heat of the moment, we tend to become defensive or even angry. Don’t! When there’s value in what’s being said, listen, identify your weakness &amp; use it to your advantage. How else will you be able to improve yourself?"
1595,2020-06-28 22:06:09+00:00,muftimenk,"We all have our difficult days. But don’t use that as an excuse to treat your loved ones badly. It’s easy to take your feelings out on those closest to you, but that doesn’t mean they deserve it. Ask them for advice on how to deal with issues that are making you so irritated!"
1596,2020-06-28 15:47:59+00:00,muftimenk,Some people will hate you because of what you’ve achieved in life. They want what you have but make no effort to do anything about it. They resort to spreading rumours &amp; gossip about you. This is a test from the Almighty. Don’t retaliate. Let the good you do speak for itself!
1597,2020-06-28 05:11:22+00:00,muftimenk,"The challenges you face in life can make you a stronger person. It also cultivates patience, a trait that is so loved by the Almighty. How you deal with challenges says a lot about you. Learn from them; apply them to your life or keep whining about it wishing it never happened!"
1598,2020-06-27 22:43:22+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll never walk alone because the Almighty is always with you. Don’t you forget that. Always have hope in the face of discouragement, faith when all seems lost. Keep your peace in times of anxiety. Never let your feelings get the better of you when you fall or feel abandoned!"

Lessons from the Liverpool Victory - Mufti Menk 

https://t.co/g7wyCxsGY0"
1600,2020-06-27 16:15:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t look for quick fix solutions. Short cuts will get you nowhere at least in your personal development. Moreover, quick fixes often backfire. The road to improving ourselves is one that’s long, continuous &amp; persistent. It requires time, commitment, self discipline &amp; hard work."
1601,2020-06-27 04:39:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you among those who’ll spend most of your time fixing other people’s problems but your life’s a mess? Remember, charity begins at home. The best way to help others is to help yourself first. Invest your time in being a better version of yourself; everything else will follow."
1602,2020-06-26 22:39:57+00:00,muftimenk,Stop sweating the small stuff. Always remember how short this life is. All it takes is a split second for things to change. Learn to be grateful. Focus on His blessings no matter how small it is. The happiest people don’t have everything but they make the most of what they have.
1603,2020-06-26 16:07:14+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be surprised if people try to detour you from your path when you’re doing well and headed in the right direction. It’s a normal human trait. Recognize it. Know their game and be on full alert. Stand your ground politely but firmly. Do what you must and don’t be distracted.
1604,2020-06-26 04:41:20+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant us the strength &amp; the courage to carry on. A lot’s going on around us &amp; it’s easy to become despondent. Our energy &amp; motivation are constantly being tested. Don’t let the pressures of life push us down. Help us not to quit but to keep going at a steady pace!
1605,2020-06-25 22:40:21+00:00,muftimenk,@Cornerstore26 Much love habeebee. You just gave me an opportunity to add value to the discussion. You said nothing wrong. Have a lovely evening!
1606,2020-06-25 22:30:07+00:00,muftimenk,"@Cornerstore26 😂Relax! When prayers are answered 30 years later &amp; the excitement is so much that the pain of previous losses is forgotten, surely the lesson learnt glares us in the face! Never give up! Never! I didn't even take sides. Beautiful religious tweet. Your turn to pray if I may add!"

1608,2020-06-25 18:17:35+00:00,muftimenk,"If your heart is not in the right place, you’ll never feel at ease. Purify your intenion in everything that you do. In this age of social media it’s easy to show off, get carried away &amp; thrive on exaggerated needs for acceptance &amp; validation. Protect your heart at all times."
1609,2020-06-25 08:41:56+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty is the Controller of Hearts. He can change things in the blink of an eye. Don’t forget! He can heal what has been hurting for years in a flash. He can forgive as He wills. Nothing is beyond the Lord of the Worlds. Have faith that things will work out in the end.
1610,2020-06-24 23:03:43+00:00,muftimenk,Pay heed to whatever comes out of your mouth. Every word you utter matters. It really does. You may not think so but trust me when I say that the power of words is immense. It can make you or break you. It has the ability to change someone’s life! Choose your words carefully!
1611,2020-06-24 13:40:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Man is always comparing. We often feel the other person is in a much better state than we are. Instead of accepting &amp; appreciating what we have, we always find a way to look at what others have. Be wary. In trying to achieve something better, one may end up losing what one has!"
1612,2020-06-24 07:02:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about how people act. That’s on them not you. Always choose kindness, that’s under your control. Spread it far and wide, whichever way you can, even if it means giving a smile or a word of encouragement. Never underestimate how contagious being kind can be!"
1613,2020-06-23 15:08:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to see the best in people. Believe the best about them too. No matter how much you disagree, try to find common ground. Spread peace. Quit fighting and bickering. Build bridges. Don’t hate. Don’t look down on anyone. Life’s too short to be doing otherwise."
1614,2020-06-22 17:00:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit stressing yourself unnecessarily. If you’ve done your best, then leave it to the Almighty. If something’s out of your hands, it deserves freedom from your mind too!  Overthinking is not going to change it. Let Him work it out for you. Be prepared for the best outcome!"
1615,2020-06-22 08:11:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Big changes can be made in small steps. If you want the change to last, then you need more than a ""just do it"" mentality. It needs to be slowly cultivated till it becomes part of you. Then pray hard &amp; ask the Almighty to guide you. If anyone can help, it's the One who made you!"
1616,2020-06-21 15:27:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of greed. And it’s not just about money. You can be greedy for material possessions, fame, compliments etc. Whatever it is, greed is a spiritual disease of the heart and is always destructive. So work on your heart to drive greed out. Learn to share, give generously!"
1617,2020-06-21 05:25:34+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty’s not only the source of love but the only One truly worthy of love! People will always let us down. Impermissible relationships will end in heartbreak. That’s why when we give them our hearts completely, we end up suffering heartbreak after heartbreak! Take heed!"
1618,2020-06-20 18:07:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you live your life to please others? If so, you’ll never know peace because nothing you do will be good enough. If you make decisions based on what others will think of you, it’s time for a rethink! Where does the Almighty figure in your life? Reflect! Live your life for Him"
1619,2020-06-20 08:31:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is really not that complicated. You reap what you sow. You get what you give. Whatever you’re criticising in others, exists in you. If you’ll only recognise it. So treat life well. What goes around comes around. Make sure you give goodness, kindness &amp; all things positive!"
1620,2020-06-19 23:31:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, Satan works the hardest when you’re about to make a breakthrough. You need to hold on to your faith, stay the course &amp; draw yourself even closer to the Almighty. Resist the temptation, ignore the whispers; keep fighting. Build a barrier by seeking refuge in your Maker!"
1621,2020-06-19 14:44:26+00:00,muftimenk,Go out of your way to become a humble person. Yes! Cultivate humility. Do it with a passion. Life will test you with anything &amp; everything. It’s easy to be humble when being tested &amp; trying to cope. But staying humble when the Almighty’s blessed you reveals your true self!
1622,2020-06-19 05:17:37+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We pray for those suffering in the world today. May the poor &amp; vulnerable have sufficient access to their basic needs. May those who have lost homes &amp; loved ones be treated with mercy &amp; compassion. Replace their panic with peace &amp; despair with hope! Aameen.
1623,2020-06-18 21:57:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever we find something that irritates us about others, it’s time to look inward, scrutinise ourselves. The tendency is to look outward. Resist the temptation. Remember, your reaction is about you. Your bias, your judgement, your prejudice. You’ll end up hurting yourself."
1624,2020-06-18 10:34:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing lasts. The same goes for people who come into your life to show you a thing or two. Remember, no one crosses your path unless it’s planned by the Almighty. It doesn’t happen by accident. So cherish the moments you have with them because not everyone will stay forever."
1625,2020-06-18 04:30:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to listen to your own voice; your own heart; your own soul. Focus on that regardless of what others might tell you. Why? Because there’s too much noise around us, loud decibels accosting us daily. Sadly, people tend to listen to all that noise instead of themselves!"
1626,2020-06-17 18:36:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be jealous when you see someone having more than you. Remember, the Almighty blesses us differently. Don’t compare. Instead show gratitude so He can bless you with even more. Never forget that He has given you so much already; honestly, you’ll never be able to count them!"
1627,2020-06-17 08:42:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you feel angry or resentful when being corrected or shown the truth? If you do, then you have a problem with pride! Be wary because even a atom’s weight of it can bar you from Paradise! So work on your heart. Purify it. Humble yourself to people. Get rid of self-importance!"
1628,2020-06-16 21:40:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people feel a little lost when they don’t get enough attention from others. So they make fun of people, belittle them and say nasty things about them in order to get the attention they so badly desire. Try to counsel them if you can. Say a prayer for them. They need it!"
1629,2020-06-16 16:11:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty does not expect us to have all the answers. He knows, as humans, our knowledge is limited. But that’s no excuse for not seeking knowledge. He expects us to learn; have unwavering faith in Him; knowing that He’s always there &amp; that He rewards those who try!"
1630,2020-06-16 04:06:53+00:00,muftimenk,Do you often feel confused &amp; unsettled? Perhaps your heart feels like something’s amiss? Learn to cultivate inner peace by drawing yourself closer to the Almighty. Trust Him completely. He will guide you through it all. He will show you where you need to go to feel whole again!
1631,2020-06-15 21:26:02+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be foolish and expose every blessing the Almighty has given you to everyone and think that they’ll be happy for you. The truth is some will but many won’t. The evil eye is real. Learn to keep things private and not to share too much with those who could possibly harm you.
1632,2020-06-15 16:35:59+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re always looking for ways to expose others, you have a problem that needs fixing. Remember, the Almighty said if you expose others, He’ll surely expose you, even if you’re hiding in the tiniest corner of the room. If you have good intentions, do it privately not publicly!"
1633,2020-06-15 05:38:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re facing right now, whatever you’re dealing with won’t last. Nothing does. So get a perspective on life. Things will get better. That’s the Almighty’s promise. Tomorrow brings new hope. Daybreak will happen. Get hold of yourself and keep moving. You’ll get there!"
1634,2020-06-14 22:44:42+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re allowed to disagree with others, state your opinion respectfully but NEVER get physical or violent. This quality makes us distinct from animals! Be civilised, listen to what others are saying but avoid knee-jerk reactions. It would save you from a whole lot of regret!"
1635,2020-06-14 10:57:18+00:00,muftimenk,Some people feel better about themselves by making others feel worse. Such people have low self-esteem; they seek to boost it by taking pot shots at others. Be careful of this group because their ego needs to be constantly fed. They’re always on the look out for more victims!
1636,2020-06-13 19:41:27+00:00,muftimenk,Be careful of slander. It can wear a hundred masks. You could be passing slanderous information unknowingly. You may have given a negative perception of another person; or you could spice up bad news to tarnish someone’s image. Don’t do it! Don’t devalue someone’s reputation!
1637,2020-06-13 08:48:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay away from insults and profanity. Exercise restraint and tolerance. It’s not easy to respond to evil with good. But we must try our best. Even when we have the power to take revenge, choose not to.  Why? Because the  Almighty is gentle &amp; loves gentleness in all matters!"
1638,2020-06-12 21:55:40+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let negative thoughts take root in your mind. Weed it out quickly once you notice it. Often we think of ‘what ifs’ and negative scenarios and we worry ourselves for no apparent reason. That’s exactly what Satan wants. Learn to have faith and trust the Almighty instead.
1639,2020-06-12 14:03:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus your attention on yourself &amp; look not for fault in others. Focus on how to be better than you used to be &amp; not better than others. Every time you focus your attention outward, every time you choose to compare yourself with others, you will lose sight of who you really are."
1640,2020-06-12 05:47:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We ask You to keep us safe as the world adjusts to a new norm. Grant us courage &amp; perseverance to face the days ahead. May faith, hope &amp; love never leave us. Guide our hearts to comfort one aother even as we keep apart. Thank You for Your Light amidst our darkness!"
1641,2020-06-11 19:39:53+00:00,muftimenk,A good way to fight hypocrisy in others is to fight it within yourself. Always set a good example. Let your integrity be your moral compass. Always stand up for what is right. Don't be quick to condemn others. It’s a dangerous hypocrisy trap when it turns out that you were wrong.
1642,2020-06-11 11:03:42+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all been through spiritual lows; disappointments, failures, temptations etc. What’s important is to trust that ultimately all that suffering won’t last; it will end in victory. Keep asking the Almighty for help even at the lowest points and to hold on to our faith firmly!"
1643,2020-06-11 05:20:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes it takes humiliation to teach us the value of humility. The truth is no matter how smart, successful, good-looking you are, nobody likes a boastful person. Nobody likes arrogance or cockiness. So make a conscious effort to stay humble always. Selflessness is humility!"
1644,2020-06-10 19:57:59+00:00,muftimenk,"When you remain calm in adversity and have strong faith, the Almighty will set things right in your life. He’ll give you back what was taken away from you. He’ll restore the goodness  others tried to rob from you. He’ll grant ease and open doors that you couldn’t open!"
1645,2020-06-10 13:34:44+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ve to admit that this year’s so far been a year where we questioned everything we believed to be “normal”.  Perhaps this is what the Almighty wants us to learn; to fully submit to His Decree. All our best laid plans have gone out of the window, a reminder of who’s in charge!"
1646,2020-06-10 05:50:09+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone says something humiliating to you, don’t take it personally.  No matter what you’ve done wrong, you don’t deserve to be humiliated. Take responsibility for your mistakes but it doesn’t mean that you’re an unworthy person who should be denigrated by someone else!"
1647,2020-06-09 15:39:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Be less quick to react to abusive people. Don't let them provoke you. That’s exactly what they want. For you to lose control and get angry. Don’t play their game. Keep your calm. Seek the Almighty’s help. Often, they are powerless when you're less reactive."
1648,2020-06-09 07:21:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Clean up your acts, not just with the Almighty but with people as well. Don’t let anyone have a single legitimate complaint against you that will negate the good you’ve done. Protect your good deeds. If you hurt someone, ask for forgiveness. Don’t delay it till the Hereafter!"
1649,2020-06-08 23:03:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose your words carefully. Prefer kind, gentle &amp; measured words over harsh speech always. Whatever you say can travel the world at lightning speed &amp; you’ll live to regret it. Miscommunication is also common, especially in this age of texting. May we always use good words!"
1650,2020-06-08 16:39:01+00:00,muftimenk,There’s no need to shout out to the world how successful you are &amp; what a charmed life you lead. People should only know what you allow them to know. Keep most of it private. Let them make their own assumptions. You can’t stop them anyway. Do you think that’s a good way to live?
1651,2020-06-08 15:29:15+00:00,muftimenk,"What is Halaal? Ever wondered? 
Here is a simple animation explaining it.

https://t.co/7LBslupRmk"
1652,2020-06-08 11:22:33+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s always good in everyone. Strive to see that in others. No matter how small the act. Accept it when they make a mistake. We’re all human and not immune to wrongdoing. Correct them if you can, patiently with a kind heart. Don’t give up on people. Say a prayer for them!"
1653,2020-06-08 04:53:16+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all made poor choices in life at some stage. Don’t beat yourself up. Instead of wasting more time &amp; energy with regrets, guilt, shame &amp; agony over what's done, use those resources to bring on change so that poor choices remain in the past &amp; serve as lessons learnt!"
1654,2020-06-07 17:41:36+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s so easy to lose your cool! Train yourself to remain calm even in difficult situations. Stand your ground firmly but politely. Let them curse &amp; swear. Choose to rise above cheap, verbal abuse that’s widespread today. They’ll realize their mistake &amp; how offensive they were!"
1655,2020-06-07 05:26:05+00:00,muftimenk,"The best way to improve your life is to do it one day at a time. It’s very tempting to cram many things all at once but don’t! You’re more likely to succeed with baby steps &amp; a huge dose of prayer &amp; supplication. Without the Almighty, nothing happens. So make that change today!"
1656,2020-06-06 21:04:22+00:00,muftimenk,"The minute you think you’re more superior than the person next to you because of your skin colour, that’s the beginning of your downfall. The Almighty looks at your heart! Get rid of any deep-seated feeling in you of one upmanship &amp; superiority. Seek refuge in Him. Save yourself!"
1657,2020-06-06 20:53:32+00:00,muftimenk,"@hehehhehehhhhhh People say all sorts of hurtful things. I'm used to those. I've had to develop a skin thicker than an elephant. But this...
I'm glad I have a sense of humour.
May the Almighty bless your heart. Aameen"
1658,2020-06-06 12:47:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When you reach a stage where you can remain calm when calamity strikes, you’ve reached spiritual maturity. When you're not negatively affected by the drama around you, it shows you have complete faith in the Almighty and you know that nothing lasts!"
1659,2020-06-06 00:19:14+00:00,muftimenk,"A sin is a sin. Even when you try to put a positive spin on a sin, it’s still a sin. As long as you’re disobeying the Almighty, it’s a sin. But the beauty is with sincere repentance all that can be erased or even converted to good deeds if the Almighty wills.  Turn back to Him!"
1660,2020-06-05 15:37:30+00:00,muftimenk,Choose kindness always. Put ourselves in someone else’s shoes instead of trying to figure out how they feel based on our limited viewpoint. How difficult is it to empathize with others when we don’t know their circumstances? It costs nothing. Just a big heart and an open mind!
1661,2020-06-05 06:02:31+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes your trials and tribulations last longer than expected. Don’t lose heart. Ask the Almighty for strength and perseverance to keep going. Giving up is never an option. We need a strong finish. Never forget that! Bear patience. A breakthrough is on the way!
1662,2020-06-04 22:46:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. As we continue to face these uncertain times, keep us firmly rooted to our faith. Guide us to be mindful of what we allow to take root in our consciousness. Keep us positive, away from toxic thoughts &amp; people, knowing that You’re in complete control of all situations."
1663,2020-06-04 11:15:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Gratitude is key. If you have a home, thank the Almighty. If you have a family, thank the Almighty. If you have both, it’s indeed a huge blessing. Think of the millions who have been displaced &amp; have nothing to call their own. Let’s cut out ingratitude from our lives!"
1664,2020-06-03 23:40:20+00:00,muftimenk,"When others take a step back and give up on doing what’s good, don’t let that be a negative pull for you to follow suit. That  shouldn’t be a catalyst for you to rethink your situation to give up as well. Instead, focus on your goal and try to strengthen it. You’ll get there!"
1665,2020-06-03 14:14:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Take a step back and look at the big picture. Looking at the nitty gritty often clouds your judgement and can even confuse you. Sure detail is important but if you lose sight of the big picture, you’ll lose sight of your final destination. And that’s what counts eventually!"
1666,2020-06-03 04:46:52+00:00,muftimenk,Guard your tongue. How often have we spoken unnecessarily just for the sake of hearing ourselves? Many feel the need to fill the void of silence with mindless dribble which often leads to more trouble. Remain silent if you don’t have anything nice to say. You won’t regret it!
1667,2020-06-02 22:55:54+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty does not promise the absence of struggle in this life. That’s why He created us. To test us. So be humble, bear good patience and do the best you can in all things. He will elevate your status. Keep negative thoughts at bay. You’ll get through this!"
1668,2020-06-02 15:03:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty has blessed you with something, accept the blessing; be grateful. The One who gave you everything can take it away in an instant. In the blink of an eye, it could be gone! Remember, there’s nothing special about you except your deeds &amp; the state of your heart."
1669,2020-06-02 08:46:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind to yourself. You’ve come this far and with the Almighty’s help you’ll get through these challenging and confusing times. Don’t give in to overthinking, focus on the tasks ahead. Guide your mind to that which is positive and beneficial. Trust that tomorrow will be better!"
1670,2020-06-01 20:12:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus on what you have, no matter how little &amp; you’ll be happy. Focus on what’s missing in your life &amp; what the neighbours have &amp; you’ll be sad. It all depends on where your focus lies in life. If it’s the Almighty’s blessings then you’ll be content! Else, you’ll be miserable!"
1671,2020-06-01 12:02:07+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have a problem with someone’s skin colour, you have a problem with the Creator. He created us in a multitude of colours so we can appreciate diversity &amp; live in harmony. Don’t let anyone tell you who is more superior. Treat people fairly. The Almighty is watching."
1672,2020-06-01 01:27:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Drop expectations. You’ll be happier with fewer disappointments. Learn to expect nothing. If you think people will stop whatever they’re doing to attend to you, you’re wrong. Don’t wait with bated breath. Instead, turn to the Almighty! He won’t disappoint!"
1673,2020-05-31 18:04:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan does not want you to repent at all. But if he cannot do that, his next best plan is to delay your repentance. He tries to tell you that it will be easier later on so sin all you want now! That’s a lie. The longer things go on, the harder it becomes to repent. Do it today!"
1674,2020-05-31 11:49:03+00:00,muftimenk,Let go of disappointments. Let go of things that didn’t work out. Let go of negative thoughts that drag you down. Let go of “nothing good ever happens in my life” feeling. Choose to focus on the good &amp; positive each day. The Almighty will turn everything to your advantage!!
1675,2020-05-31 04:39:14+00:00,muftimenk,"No skin color is superior over the other. All shades of colours are beautiful. Remember, the Almighty doesn’t tolerate arrogance and racism. It’s a sin. A huge sin! He is only concerned with the state of your heart and your level of piety. Keep your focus on the right things."
1676,2020-05-30 22:24:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Do we reject someone only because of his skin colour? Answer that honestly. The truth is nobody is born a racist. You have to be taught. Are we dealing with racism, bigotry &amp; prejudice in our own lives, so that we can be examples to our children &amp; those under our charge? Reflect!"
1677,2020-05-30 14:31:18+00:00,muftimenk,The winners are those who are happy with the way the Almighty has made them. You don't have to follow what others are doing to be considered good looking or acceptable. You ARE good looking. You ARE original. You are YOU! So just be YOU! Not someone else!
1678,2020-05-30 03:41:31+00:00,muftimenk,Put an end to racism &amp; violence. Stop labeling people. We're all part of the Almighty's creation. How difficult is it to be kind and to promote peace? It costs nothing. Let’s make a concerted effort to spread this message far and wide. Start by being a living example of it!
1679,2020-05-29 17:35:42+00:00,muftimenk,Break free from old mindsets and traditions; especially those that hold us back from doing what the Almighty has prescribed for us. Sometimes we do things just because they’ve been passed down from our forefathers. Reasses your situation and why you do what you’ve been doing!
1680,2020-05-29 07:57:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When you regret your sins, feel sad for having committed them and feel pain when you remember them, these are signs of faith and sincere repentance. However, after repenting, Satan will cause you to doubt the Almighty’s Mercy. Don’t despair. Don’t fall for his trick! Move on!"
1681,2020-05-28 23:46:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep our hope alive in these turbulent times. We are nothing without You. Without You, we can’t carry on &amp; face  the obstacles ahead. Give us the strength &amp; will to confront  life’s challenges. Nothing will happen without Your Will. Only You can help us move forward!"
1682,2020-05-28 17:00:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Blesssed are those who go through so much, yet they put up a brave front &amp; make it seem like everything is okay. They take their troubles to the Almighty, not to people or social media. They’re a rare breed in this day &amp; age where most things get an airing on social platforms!"
1683,2020-05-28 08:32:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Patience is key! No matter what circumstances you find yourself in, be patient. Your neighbour  may be blessed with what he’s been praying for but you must remain patient. Perhaps the Almighty wants you to call out to Him just a little more. He will reward the doers of good!"
1684,2020-05-27 18:27:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s face it. There’s so much uncertainty in our lives today given the global pandemic that it’s easy to feel helpless. But no matter what you’re going through, be certain that the Almighty is watching over you. He has plans for you. He will see you through everything."
1685,2020-05-27 01:24:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Never take your blessings for granted. The Almighty will see to that. So always be grateful, no matter how small the blessing. He never sends a calamity except that ease follows thereafter. Keep connecting with Him; you’ll see how much ease and inner peace you get in your life."
1686,2020-05-26 16:24:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Time to hear from you.

This Ramadan was"
1687,2020-05-26 16:17:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let your grief consume you to such an extent that you forget who’s in control. Try to step away from your broken state, even if just for a moment. You’ll see things clearer; realise that you own nothing at all. Everything’s on loan from the Almighty. This world’s temporary!"
1688,2020-05-26 09:47:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of the internet. Don't let it turn you into a cynical person. It can crush your optimism and give you a low self-esteem. Whatever you do, don’t let it define your worth. Rise above it and resist the temptation to compare what’s going on with someone else’s life!"
1689,2020-05-26 00:23:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Such is life. One minute you’re up, the next you’re down. Today you’re counting your loss, tomorrow the Almighty will reward you with huge gains. Never despair whatever happens in life. He will remove people &amp; things from us but He will also replace them with what we truly need!"
1690,2020-05-25 09:56:54+00:00,muftimenk,"All the prayers you’ve been making, the dreams you’ve been wanting so badly, trust the Almighty because He has got it under control. He is going to ensure that things fall into place. He is going to make things happen that you could never have done on your own. Have firm faith!"
1691,2020-05-24 21:04:20+00:00,muftimenk,May the Almighty fill our hearts with compassion on this beautiful day of #Eid . Spread the joy to all around you and don’t forget to reach out to those in need. #EidMubarak to all of you. Have a beautiful time with your loved ones.
1692,2020-05-24 16:23:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Make it a point to touch lives &amp; hearts whenever you get the opportunity this #Eid. Give, forgive &amp; apologise. If you find difficulty doing it, make a commitment &amp; start on this day of #Eid. Focus on things that matter. Cut out distractions &amp; aim to please the Almighty!"
1693,2020-05-24 00:00:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Eid Message of love, whether you're celebrating today or tomorrow! #EidMubarak #EidUlFitr #muftimenk https://t.co/B3BPh4v0Vc"
1694,2020-05-23 19:11:24+00:00,muftimenk,"The moon was sighted in Mozambique so we will be having Eid Sunday 24th May 2020 in Zimbabwe too Alhamdulillah. #EidMubarak #EidUlFitr from Mufti Menk, Omar and Hana! ♥️ https://t.co/T3uAQoUKKn"
1695,2020-05-23 12:31:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Your struggle is an act of worship. The Almighty loves the humble who is not arrogant, who is broken and surrenders himself completely to His Lord. So there’s wisdom in your trials and tribulations. Don’t scoff at them. Learn from them and use them to draw yourself closer to Him."
1696,2020-05-23 04:07:43+00:00,muftimenk,People may not always hear what you say but they will  definitely observe if you’re practising what you’re preaching. Always lead by example. You don’t have to be in a position of authority or power to do that. Live a life of goodness and the message will spread far and wide!
1697,2020-05-22 22:47:55+00:00,muftimenk,The #PakistanPlaneCrash earlier has saddened me. My heartfelt condolences to the families of those who returned to their Maker during this Blessed Month of Ramadan. May the Almighty grant them the loftiest ranks of Paradise &amp; calm their loved ones with beautiful patience. Aameen
1698,2020-05-22 21:05:01+00:00,muftimenk,"If you let Ramadan pass by without seeking &amp; being granted His Forgiveness, you have truly missed out. When then will you be forgiven, if not in this month? So don't let ignorance &amp; negligence overtake you. Seek His Forgiveness to get closer to Him. Do it in these last hours!"
1699,2020-05-22 16:18:14+00:00,muftimenk,@snyxay Eid is on Sunday in most countries of the world! Alhamdulillah
1700,2020-05-22 10:49:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We thank You for giving us this blessed month amid very different conditions. Every crisis in life is an opportunity to get closer to You in complete trust. You have shown immense blessings &amp; how patience is key to our suffering. Protect us, grant us ease &amp; forgiveness!"
1701,2020-05-21 22:09:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Charity Increases sustenance and protects wealth. It’s not too late to give generously before the blessed month leaves us. One way to increase our rewards immeasurably is to give because no matter how small it is, it’s something that will protect us in the Hereafter!"
1702,2020-05-21 10:59:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Always stay humble. No matter how successful you are, don’t let your ego take over the controls driving you towards social status instead of progress. Always keep learning &amp; improving; aware that there’s so much more to know. After all, everybody knows something that you don’t!"
1703,2020-05-20 23:49:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Arrogance and pride can be found in the hearts of many but these are traits which the Almighty has warned us to stay away from. Don’t be deceived into believing that arrogance is wisdom. Far from it! Remember, it is not all about you. Always consider those around you as well!"
1704,2020-05-20 12:36:00+00:00,muftimenk,Keep going even when you find it difficult to worship. Keep going when you find your tongue is unable to utter much. Keep going when you feel it’s a bad day &amp; you want to give up. Keep going when you feel your patience running out. Keep going because He knows your struggle!
1705,2020-05-20 04:24:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan has ONE goal. To take you to Hellfire. If you love this world, his job is easier. If you're close to the Almighty, he'll tempt you! If you're struggling to get back on track, he will do his utmost. Seek the Almighty’s help. He will guide you. Don’t let people mock you."
1706,2020-05-19 22:08:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Be consistent in your acts of worship. Small, daily doses are better than one huge chunk and then nothing at all. The Almighty loves those deeds that are done consistently. Remember, baby steps and build it up progressively. That way you’re more likely to have staying power."
1707,2020-05-19 12:08:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Give generously especially in this month. But don’t waste your good deeds. A man who gives &amp; hides it so that his right hand doesn’t know what his left is doing, basically cares more about helping others than what people will think of him. So learn to give discreetly!"
1708,2020-05-18 21:13:29+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’ve been enjoying the extra worship in this blessed month, it’s time to ponder &amp; recalibrate your life. It’s time to get closer to the Almighty. Make a commitment to continue what you’ve been doing after this month is over. Commit to put in extra effort &amp; time for Him!"
1709,2020-05-18 10:25:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t complicate life. It’s actually very straightforward. What you give, you get back eventually. What you sow, you reap. Spread goodness and kindness, it willl come back to you in many forms. The Almighty loves the doers of good. What are you waiting for? Start today!"
1710,2020-05-17 22:39:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Most great changes are preceded by chaos. So if you feel like your life is a mess right now, take heart. Keep believing it will fall into place soon. Keep going knowing that the Best of Planners will unfold the course you should be taking. You’ll be pleased you didn’t give up!"
1711,2020-05-17 12:52:49+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what’s going on, always uphold decent character &amp;  conduct. Let them criticise, let them pick on petty issues, let them say nasty things. Be good, be kind-hearted even if they are not. Remember there’s Judgement Day! They’ll pay their dues on The Day of Recompense."
1712,2020-05-17 05:37:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Our greatest disappointment comes when our expectations of who we want people to be don’t match the reality of who they really are. It’s easy to say don’t have expectations, but as humans we do. So be realistic in your expectations. Learn to depend on the Almighty alone!"
1713,2020-05-16 23:20:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remember that the Almighty is able to bring you through the unknown, the unseen, and the unexpected. These are situations which our normal minds cannot fathom. But leave it to Him. It’s part of His Plan. All you have to do is to trust Him without an iota of doubt!"
1714,2020-05-16 12:45:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, you don’t need people’s endorsement to be happy. If they have issues with you, it’s not about you, it’s about their insecurities. Just be sure you haven’t hurt anyone. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Let it go &amp; seek your approval only from the Almighty."
1715,2020-05-16 05:25:09+00:00,muftimenk,It happens to us all. The guilt of not using our time better. But the Almighty is most Merciful. He sends us reminder after reminder. He’s the most patient. He never gives up on us. So why do we give up on ourselves? Don’t! Persevere just a little more to get back on track!
1716,2020-05-15 21:50:26+00:00,muftimenk,"When you see others doing well &amp; having a seemingly good life, it’s easy to get discouraged &amp; think that your life isn’t going to change. Everyone has struggles in life, Everyone has disappointments, but if you think good thoughts of the Almighty, He will bless you immensely."
1717,2020-05-15 12:35:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, help us to realise our #Ramadan goal in getting closer to You. Soften the hearts of those who’ve yet to feel the sweetness of this month; don’t let them give in to despair. Give them the strength to keep trying. We ask for Your Mercy &amp; Forgiveness"
1718,2020-05-15 03:33:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep knocking on His Door. Keep asking not just for the ordinary but the extraordinary. For anything &amp; everything. Even for whatever your mind tells you is impossible. He’s the Lord  of the Worlds. He’s the Owner of Miracles. If He says, BE; It shall be!"
1719,2020-05-14 22:21:51+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want to change, start by setting small goals from now. Change doesn't usually happen overnight. You may not be able to do everything the Almighty has prescribed instantly. Strive &amp; show Him you’re sincere, He will pave a way for you! Make this #Ramadan a game changer!"
1720,2020-05-14 12:47:44+00:00,muftimenk,"If your #Ramadan hasn’t been what you envisioned, don’t lose hope. As long as you’ve been trying your best, the Almighty knows &amp; will reward you. You may be on a spiritual high or you may be spiritually broken, whichever the case, don’t stop asking Him. Don’t stop repenting."
1721,2020-05-14 05:31:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t ignore the little warnings you get from your spiritual heart. Make it a priority to deal with emotions like anger, bitterness, resentment &amp; bad attitudes. Don’t let such feelings fester. Seek the Almighty’s help to restore peace and calmness so you can feel whole again!"
1722,2020-05-13 23:28:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Rumours are dangerous; they travel extremely fast. You could have entertained a rumour &amp; not even knew; or worse you started it. Some people start a rumour simply because they have nothing to say. You may think it’s harmless. It’s not, flee from it. Have nothing to do with it!"
1723,2020-05-13 13:32:56+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in a judgmental society. People will form their own conclusions of you based on a tweet or a Facebook status. They judge you on your appearance or even your accent. Just because you’re different from them, they look down on you. Stand your ground firmly but politely."
1724,2020-05-13 07:09:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Patience is indeed a virtue. We’re taught its value &amp; how the Almighty rewards those who embody this quality. But at times as humans, we tend to get emotional over something &amp; we run out of patience. Don’t feel bad. Keep the Almighty in focus. He will find a way out for you!"
1725,2020-05-12 23:38:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Targeting women and newborn at a maternity hospital is a new low. It is heart-wrenching and wrong on all counts. My heart is shattered. What a senseless, brutal, barbaric act in the blessed month of #Ramadan. May the Almighty deal with the perpetrators of the #KabulAttack."
1726,2020-05-12 21:43:32+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think you’re a pious person &amp; that you’re close to the Almighty. But if your character is flawed, you curse &amp; swear, your heart is filled with envy &amp; hatred, you gossip &amp; backbite,  you’re argumentative &amp; highly intolerant, then this can’t be further from the truth!"
1727,2020-05-12 12:19:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't do anything to compromise the sanctity of these last nights in #Ramadan. Don't argue, swear, backbite or gossip. Focus solely on the Almighty. Do more good deeds, give generously and make an intent that every little bit you do is for Him and Him alone!"
1728,2020-05-12 04:18:55+00:00,muftimenk,Giving what you love is the highest form of giving. We can give whatever we want but try to reach this level of giving. You’ll feel a huge sense of gratification envelop you. It also shows the state of your heart. It’s not too late to do this. Try it in these last blessed nights!
1729,2020-05-11 21:27:47+00:00,muftimenk,To worry means we do not trust the Almighty. The key to overcoming our discontentment and lack of faith is to get to know Him better &amp; get closer to Him. Has He not provided for you even when you never asked? Think about it. That should grow your confidence and trust in Him!
1730,2020-05-11 14:09:45+00:00,muftimenk,It all boils down to your heart. The Almighty will weigh your deeds and not count them on Judgement Day. He looks at your intent and how much heart was in it when the deed was done. Quality over quantity above all. So purify your heart; do it solely for Him and not to show off!
1731,2020-05-11 08:41:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be among those who only experience hunger &amp; thirst from the fast and attain nothing. These are people who destroy the rewards of their fast by engaging in gossip, backbiting, cursing, lying, etc. Remember that the Almighty is not in need of the fast of such a person!"
1732,2020-05-10 15:07:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Your physical appearance doesn't determine your worth.  We need to look at what’s inside: traits like kindness, generosity &amp; character.  Next time you hear others mocking the way someone looks, don't encourage it. Don't feel the need to add your own comments. Put an end to it!"
1733,2020-05-10 03:19:18+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t wait for things to fall into place before you start worshipping the Almighty. Do it now &amp; He will make things right for you. He promises peace during chaos. Joy when things seem uncertain. Hope when circumstances seem hopeless. Call on Him. He’s your Provider &amp; Sustainer!
1734,2020-05-09 10:14:22+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re among those who’ve lost your job in this pandemic, don’t despair. It can be heart-wrenching experience but remember the Almighty knows what we don’t. Perhaps He’s redirecting your life towards something better. Bear patience. You’ll be grateful for the next phase!"
1735,2020-05-08 21:58:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Words are powerful. What you say can be held against you, perhaps not now but certainly in the Court of the Almighty. So repent &amp; seek forgiveness from Him &amp; the one you’ve wronged. Choose your words wisely before speaking. It’s good to stay quiet if you don’t have much to say!"
1736,2020-05-08 12:06:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Shower us with Your infinite mercy, relieve our fears &amp; anxieties &amp; grant us a peaceful mind &amp; a heart full of hope. We ask for patience and wisdom to make the correct decisions in life. Guide us during this difficult journey towards healing and recovery. Aameen."
1737,2020-05-07 22:49:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you ask for, if it’s meant for you, you’ll get. No matter how long the wait. The Almighty will see to it. So always ask with conviction &amp; a pure heart. Leave the timing to Him. Don’t rush Him. Don’t give Him ultimatums. Our job is to live a life that’s pleasing to Him."
1738,2020-05-07 15:31:20+00:00,muftimenk,You need to get this right. Being a leader is more than just wanting to lead. Good leaders empower others to be great. They’re honest with people. They don’t pretend to know it all. They seek ideas and feedback from people. Because that’s the way you grow &amp; become better!
1739,2020-05-07 05:08:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Forbearance is a quality that the Almighty holds in high regard. Whether it manifests as patience, endurance, gentleness, tolerance, or moderation, forbearance is woven into all this and more. Train yourself to cultivate this habit and make it a part of your daily life! Try it!"
1740,2020-05-06 21:53:08+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s not always easy to walk the path to your destination. But you must and you will. No matter how difficult it gets, no matter what the challenges along the way, steel yourself. Giving up is not an option. Satan is waiting on the sidelines to see you fall. Don’t let him win!"
1741,2020-05-06 12:53:59+00:00,muftimenk,Be comfortable walking in your own shoes at your own pace. Don’t compare yourself to others. It’s the trap of Satan to always make you yearn for what you don’t have but your neighbour does. Your journey is yours alone. Keep your focus. Keep going and you’ll get there!
1742,2020-05-06 03:12:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Forgive generously. This is the month of forgiveness. Let it go. Don’t keep it inside &amp; let it fester. It’s not healthy. Besides all that negative emotion is taking up too much space. Allow yourself to fil that space with love, compassion and peace. You’ll feel much better!"
1743,2020-05-05 14:16:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have any genuine friends? Those who are not driven by money, status, and ego? To be honest, it gets harder to find such people in this day and age. They exist but are few and far between. So if you know one, you’re truly blessed. Respect them. Keep them close."
1744,2020-05-04 23:07:29+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be afraid to shed tears. Cry all you want to the Almighty. Cry your heart out if you must. It’s a quality of the righteous. Tears are prayers too. They travel to Him when we are so overcome with emotion that we can’t find the right words to say. He’s the best listener.
1745,2020-05-04 17:02:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Even the greatest of deeds can be of no benefit if the hearts are sick; if the hearts are corrupt; if the hearts are laced with envy, pride, jealousy, hatred etc. So pay close attention to the state of your heart because everything you do flows from it!"
1746,2020-05-04 07:52:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Each time you undertake something, it could fail, it could crumble. That’s the reality. But when you trust that the Almighty always has your best interest, things take on a different turn. He will steer &amp; guide you towards what’s best. Never doubt that. He’s your Best Planner!"
1747,2020-05-03 23:14:04+00:00,muftimenk,We don’t want anything or anyone to distract us from our worship in this blessed month. We need good people to encourage us to get the most out of it. May the Almighty bless all of us with righteous company &amp; people who will benefit us in both this world and the hereafter.
1748,2020-05-03 08:23:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Times are hard without a doubt. Many are ill, have lost their jobs etc. But always believe that things will get better. Remember, everything in this world is temporary. So the sadness, anxiety &amp; overthinking will pass. Bear patience for a while longer. Eternal bliss awaits us!"
1749,2020-05-02 16:21:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Every cloud has a silver lining. This pandemic has united us. We’re all in the same boat. Use this time to be productive, encourage and motivate one another. Instead of just hoping things will return to normal, start thinking of how we can adjust to a new world, post pandemic!"
1750,2020-05-02 03:04:46+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to form your own conclusion based on what you see. Don’t. Resist that temptation. Why? Because you will never know the true situation if you’ve not walked in someone’s shoes. Remember, the ignorant sees only with his eyes. Learn to see
with your heart and mind!"
1751,2020-05-01 21:52:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you more likely to focus on problems or solutions? Yes, major hurdles are depressing &amp; they’re often unavoidable. But your attitude directly influences your ability to solve them. The Almighty has given us the mental capacity to assess our situation. Stay on top of it all!"
1752,2020-05-01 03:14:48+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Keep us firm in faith as we go through a very different #Ramadan. We’re realising the blessings  attached to this &amp; we’re grateful for everything You’ve sent our way. Keep us always hopeful as we pray for healing the world over not just physically but in our hearts!
1753,2020-04-30 16:43:22+00:00,muftimenk,Make it a habit to always speak the truth. That way you don’t have to worry about which version of the story you were telling others. Just one version &amp; that’s the truth. Never live in fear of anything or anyone except the One who made you. He’s the only One you’re answerable to.
1754,2020-04-30 10:12:53+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is many of us are unhappy because we are so preoccupied with what others think of us. Seriously, this has to stop. Happiness comes from your link with your Maker; it comes from within. A calm heart and peaceful mind can only be truly achieved when you have this link!"
1755,2020-04-29 23:17:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t always look for the easy path &amp; short term gratification. Remember, life’s a test. It requires a lot of hard work &amp; long term perspective. It’s not easy. It’s not for the faint hearted. Just as Paradise is not easy. Prepare well today so you won’t have to regret tomorrow!"
1756,2020-04-29 13:33:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay away from obscene speech, ignorant acts, argument and insults not just because you’re fasting but because they incur the Almighty’s wrath. Such actions are often intended to offend, intimidate or otherwise cause emotional or psychological  trauma. Clean up your acts!"
1757,2020-04-29 07:00:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Despite all the negativity around us, there are thousands making the best of situations that are far from ideal. These people never complain, don’t make excuses &amp; continue to persevere. Nothing deters them. They put their heads down &amp; carry on. Take a leaf form their book."
1758,2020-04-28 18:52:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t short-change yourself. Don’t always think you can’t do it. Whenever the Almighty puts something in your heart, go for it! If you have unwavering faith in Him, you will have the strength to face whatever comes your way. Believe in yourself and believe that He has your back!"
1759,2020-04-28 11:00:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Never for a moment think that your possessions are the sum of your life. They are not! You’re not defined by your status. Remember, everything is a gift from the Almighty. He’s watching how you utilise ever single gift. So do what’s right!"
1760,2020-04-28 04:23:00+00:00,muftimenk,Some find it so hard to say no because they are scared of being judged. They're scared of what others will think of them once they change their attitude &amp; stop saying yes to everything. The truth is people will form an opinion of you no matter what you do! So decline politely.
1761,2020-04-27 21:26:09+00:00,muftimenk,"We all have many sides to us. We have one side we show to the world. Then there’s the side no one ever sees, that’s the most important one. Yes! Who are we really when no one is seeing? That’s the side the Almighty looks at. It sets our moral compass and defines our character."
1762,2020-04-27 14:53:18+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let this world dictate to you what beauty is. Your figure &amp; complexion or skin tone don’t mean anything if you have a bad heart. Beauty is not what people see when they look at you; beauty is what they discover when they find out what is inside of you.
1763,2020-04-27 11:16:32+00:00,muftimenk,Train yourself to think about your blessings instead of your hardship. Have faith that none of this will last so don’t live in never-ending defeat. Challenge yourself to stop talking about the problem &amp; start talking about the solution. Have a positive mindset &amp; you’re a winner!
1764,2020-04-27 04:51:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let bitterness and resentment take root in your heart. They’re poison which will harm your soul eventually. Let go of the hurt or hate that comes with it. If you’ve been wronged, turn to the Almighty and let Him heal you. You’ll feel whole again with a much lighter heart!"
1765,2020-04-26 21:25:11+00:00,muftimenk,"We often talk just so that we won’t have this void of silence; thinking that silence is something to be ashamed of; something to be avoided. But it’s not. There’s nothing wrong with silence. In fact, if you have nothing worthwhile to say, it’s best that you remain silent!"
1766,2020-04-26 10:49:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Take care of your spiritual growth. You can’t give from an empty vessel. Make a goal each day to draw yourself closer to the Almighty. Always have hope. Hope in His Mercy. Hope in His Paradise. Hope that He is waiting to forgive. Ask Him, plead with Him. Cry out to Him!"
1767,2020-04-26 03:39:43+00:00,muftimenk,Believe in yourself. Trust that the Almighty has equipped you with what you need to succeed. You have what it takes. You have a light within you that you can use to shine bright and elevate other people as well as reach personal success.⁣ Work hard and He will pave the way!
1768,2020-04-25 21:37:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't waste your good deeds by engaging in gossip, slander etc. You'll end up a bankrupt having to pay off all those you've wronged.  Stay away from ill-feelings, jealousy &amp; hatred this month. Your heart will be better prepared to stay away from such feelings beyond #Ramadan!"
1769,2020-04-25 09:05:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s work on our hearts this #Ramadan. Soften it &amp; purify it. Renew our link with the Almighty &amp; celebrate revelation of the greatest message from our Lord. For a month that's bountiful with deeds, start repenting sincerely. Commit to change for the better &amp; discard bad habits!"
1770,2020-04-24 22:38:50+00:00,muftimenk,"This #Ramadan, make a firm commitment to use words to build people up. Stop using foul language, bad speech &amp; don’t curse &amp; swear. Words are powerful. They leave a lasting impact. So let nothing else but good come out of your mouth. The effects will resonate far and wide."
1771,2020-04-24 12:23:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Let us enter this blessed month with a humble heart. Amid trying times, we beg you to open spiritual doorways for us and answer our prayers. Keep us steadfast, heal us and make us whole again. May we also use this time for renewal and to gain closeness to You. Aameen."
1772,2020-04-24 05:35:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit worrying especially over things you can’t control. If you want peace of mind, hand things over to the Almighty after you’ve done your best. You’ve played your part so now let Him take over. Remember, whatever you let into your mind has the potential to manifest in your life."
1773,2020-04-23 12:25:54+00:00,muftimenk,"As the blessed month descends on us, be aware of those who will try to cause discord among people. Stay away from both actions and words that may cause regret in this month of Mercy. Get involved in only that which is good and beneficial. Stay away from conflict and drama."
1774,2020-04-23 04:16:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through, you need to start healing. Because if you don’t, you’ll end up venting your frustrations on other people and that’s bad. Keep your heart light, always believing they that the Almighty wants the best for you and He will always facilitate a way out!"
1775,2020-04-22 20:58:00+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to get on with your life. Don’t worry about what other people are doing; it’s none of your business. Let people do what they have to do. You must set up your own boundaries &amp; respect other people’s markers as well when it comes to such things. It’s a much needed skill.
1776,2020-04-22 10:46:44+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s so much uncertainty in the world now that it’s easy to feel hopeless. Don’t waste another moment wishing things were different. Where you are right now is where the Almighty wants you to be. Trust Him. Believe in Him. Whether it’s a blessing or a lesson, thank Him!"
1777,2020-04-22 04:22:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t keep harping on negative things and whatever’s wrong in your life. Remember, you’ve been in situations where you thought you’d never make it but you did. You’re more resilient than you think you are. You survived it! Trust the Almighty to see you through the journey."
1778,2020-04-21 19:26:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to depend on the Almighty for everything. He wants to help you, heal you, empower you, comfort you; the list is endless. Make Him the source of everything that you need instead of depending on people who will often let you down. Have good thoughts of Him &amp; trust Him always!"
1779,2020-04-21 08:15:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t despair if the world looks like an unfamiliar place right now. Keep pushing forward. Our faith keeps us going. Amidst the turmoil &amp; turbulence, we know the Almighty’s in full control. He’s promised that no trial sent our way is a waste. Learn from it. Become better people!"
1780,2020-04-20 09:50:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you get anxious waiting for something? Do you feel fear and excitement at the same time? At times, we just can’t help feeling that way. But bearing patience with a good attitude is not so common anymore, in a world where everything happens instantly. Learn to wait patiently!"
1781,2020-04-19 21:40:59+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, we all struggle with many issues but in particular, some struggle more with anger. Anger acts as a poison to the body, both physically &amp; spiritually. It can mess up your whole being. You need to protect your heart from it by constantly seeking the Almighty’s help."
1782,2020-04-19 12:17:35+00:00,muftimenk,Hope is the cornerstone of our faith. Always have hope in the Almighty’s Mercy. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Holding on to hope is your greatest strength. Use it to anchor you in times of crisis. The situation could always be worse. But he who has hope has everything!
1783,2020-04-18 23:04:02+00:00,muftimenk,Be a good role model for your child; especially now as you’re spending more time at home in their presence. Instil the right habits from an early age. Our actions speak louder than our words. Children don’t judge you. They take note of what you do. So do what you want them to do!
1784,2020-04-18 15:11:08+00:00,muftimenk,"No one will know what you’re truly experiencing. Your situation and the depths of pain. No one can possibly know or understand except for the Almighty himself. He knows your pain. He is always there, reaching out to pull you out of the pit of despair. Reach out to Him!"
1785,2020-04-17 19:51:28+00:00,muftimenk,Trust the Almighty in all that you do. Don’t try to figure out everything on your own. You won’t be able to anyway. You’ll end up frustrated. Watch how your plans unfold and pay attention to the things He’s showing you. He will keep you on track.  Don’t assume  you know it all!

1787,2020-04-17 11:25:11+00:00,muftimenk,We are each on our own journey. Keep your eyes focused on the road ahead. Run your own race. Don’t get distracted by looking at what someone else is doing. And don’t worry about what anyone thinks. It’s irrelevant! You’re answerable to the Almighty. Get your priorities right!
1788,2020-04-17 00:48:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. It’s been a difficult period for all. You’ve seen how vulnerable we are, You’ve seen our weakness. But in all this, we lay our complete trust in You. Bring healing to those who are ill. Protect those who are most at risk. Comfort those who have lost a loved one."
1789,2020-04-16 14:53:03+00:00,muftimenk,Do you feel confused and lost? Do you feel unsure what to do next? Do you feel helpless? Do you feel broken and beaten? Do you feel like a failure? Almighty! I need you more than ever now. I can’t do it on my own. Remove the obstacles from my heart so I can get closer to You!
1790,2020-04-16 04:06:29+00:00,muftimenk,Anger &amp; jealousy are common human traits. But they are displeasing &amp; self-destructing if they get out of control. You’ll only be hurting yourself before others when you get angry or jealous. You’ll end up unhappy &amp; dissatisfied. Let go of such feelings. Learn to forgive &amp; heal!
1791,2020-04-15 20:47:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind to people in word and deed. We tend to overlook this important trait. It’s also one of the means of removing worry, distress and anxiety. When you show kindness solely for the sake of the Almighty, He will bless you in ways you never imagined &amp; open doors for you!"
1792,2020-04-15 15:39:12+00:00,muftimenk,"The best way to respond to this pandemic is to maintain a sense of calm &amp; hope. It can be difficult with the influx of daily news that causes anxiety. But we must, for our own sanity. Listen to what the experts tell you, not those who fear monger. Above all, trust the Almighty."
1793,2020-04-15 08:14:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Differ by all means; differ strongly if need be. But never insult or belittle those who disagree with you. Learn to voice your opinion respectfully, in the most beautiful way. Listen attentively; even if we disagree, do so respectfully. We must show that we care for each other!"
1794,2020-04-14 22:02:03+00:00,muftimenk,Do you have the tendency to pick on the smallest thing that you think is amiss and make it look like the biggest mistake? Refrain from being so harsh. Only the Almighty knows what’s inside people’s hearts. Look at others with the eyes of mercy and He will do the same with you!
1795,2020-04-14 12:11:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you know those who love name dropping? Those who don’t care who you are or where you’re from. They just want to know who you know, what you do and how you can help them. Be careful of such superficial people. They won’t hesitate to use you to suit their whims &amp; fancies!"
1796,2020-04-13 23:05:10+00:00,muftimenk,"If you are fearful today for whatever reason, remember the Almighty’s promise that ease will come after hardship. His Word is filled with integrity. He will fulfil His Promise. We need to have firm faith. It’s easy to be distracted by the noise around. Learn to shut them out!"
1797,2020-04-13 13:00:06+00:00,muftimenk,"You can’t expect to change if you keep making excuses for anything that goes wrong with you. Take accountability for your actions &amp; take responsibility for your decisions. Don’t play the blame game. Try to learn from your mistakes, which in turn will help you be a better person."
1798,2020-04-12 16:02:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Check your “friends” list from time to time. If you have more of those who are only there when you’re smiling, it’s time to rethink the list! Keep those who are there for you when you face storms in life close to your heart. They’re the ones whose friendship you need to nurture"
1799,2020-04-11 23:12:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit worrying about your past. Things happen for a reason. The Almighty never wastes a moment of what you have experienced. What you went through in the past can be the catalyst for change that’s needed for tomorrow. Remember, if He is for you, nobody can be against you!"
1800,2020-04-11 08:55:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Gratitude is key to success in this world &amp; the Hereafter. A grateful heart is everything. Remember, the Almighty’s unaffected if you become ungrateful. We thank Him for our own benefit. It’s only through sincere thankfulness that we can achieve whatever He has laid out for us!"
1801,2020-04-10 22:48:22+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t burn bridges just because you think you’ve arrived at a desired level in life &amp; don’t look down on those doing poorly in life. The truth is life has a way of giving back to you what you dish out to others. What goes around comes around. So be wary when  dealing with others!
1802,2020-04-10 15:33:46+00:00,muftimenk,Be kind to everyone. Never think you're above others.The trouble with those who appear pious is that they think they’re on a higher level and scoff at everyone else who may seem less pious! It’s a terrible trait to have. Don’t be hard on people. Piety comes with gentleness.
1803,2020-04-09 22:35:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We’re living in heartbreaking times as the global health crisis from the virus escalates. Grant ease to families who have lost loved ones, healthcare personnel risking their own lives. We know You are our ever-present help in distressing times. Let us keep hope alive!"
1804,2020-04-09 10:10:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Every part of the world is infected by the virus and indeed the aura of terror has spread far and wide. But amid all the doom and gloom, there’s indeed a sliver lining. Nature is slowly recovering from pollution, families are spending more time together. We will get through this!"
1805,2020-04-08 19:45:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste time worrying. It robs you of your peace, clouds  your judgement &amp; keeps you busy doing nothing. Seek comfort from the Almighty.  Pour your heart out to Him. Let Him take over. You’ll feel a sense of relief knowing He will open doors you thought were closed forever."
1806,2020-04-07 23:28:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t overthink. Don’t overreact. Now, more than ever, we need to learn how to handle our emotions and stop ourselves from stressing out. There’s so much going on around us that it’s easy to fly off the handle. Don’t. Control yourself. Seek your strength form the Almighty!"
1807,2020-04-07 10:22:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Prayer is not about you getting what you want from the Almighty as &amp; when you want it. It’s more than that. The act of connecting with Him, building your relationship with Him, how you ask Him - all these are key! Keep the communication going daily, not just when you’re in need!"
1808,2020-04-07 00:35:41+00:00,muftimenk,"During these stressful days, be selective when engaging others. Ask yourself, “Do I need to handle this right now?” If things don’t require immediate response, spend some time reflecting before answering. You’ll make wiser decisions when you’ve had  time to calm down &amp; reflect."
1809,2020-04-06 15:23:35+00:00,muftimenk,Keep your sense of inner peace. Use only kind words and don’t provoke others. Tensions are high right now as the world finds itself in the midst of a global pandemic. Normal ways of life are being challenged and it’s understandable that more people are feeling a little on-edge.
1810,2020-04-05 22:21:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful when you’ve hurt someone deliberately. If you’re guilty, apologise as soon as possible. Don’t hesitate. You may not have time tomorrow. May the Almighty protect us from being the source of pain and tears in someone else's life! May He forgive our sins and shortcoming!"
1811,2020-04-05 12:59:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Why is it that at times, the immoral, unethical, impermissible way of doing things appeal to us? It’s because we’re human &amp; Satan tempts us with worldly distractions. If we remain conscious of the Almighty, He will provide for us in ways that we never expected. Remain steadfast!"
1812,2020-04-04 20:54:49+00:00,muftimenk,"If you feel like nothing seems to be going right, don’t despair. The Almighty didn’t promise us a straight route to Paradise. Expect twists &amp; turns. Bumpy rides. Disappointments. They will happen at some stage. It’s all according to His Plan. Bear patience &amp; you’ll get there!"
1813,2020-04-03 23:31:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Misinformation is bad news. Actually, in our current climate, misinformation is lethal. It can kill. So please be aware of what you’re spreading. If you cannot verify it, it’s best not to spread it. It’s better to err on the side of caution than to cause panic and pandemonium!"
1814,2020-04-03 09:02:33+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. You’re our refuge and strength. We know that everything is in Your Sovereign control. We know that You will heal the world from this virus. Have mercy on us. May compassion and empathy be our touchstones when dealing with people during this difficult time. Aameen!
1815,2020-04-02 22:00:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful when you’ve hurt someone deliberately. If you’re guilty, apologise as soon as possible. Don’t hesitate. You may not have time tomorrow. May the Almighty protect us from being the source of pain and tears in someone else's life! May He forgive our sins and shortcoming!"
1816,2020-04-02 14:31:19+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel like giving up, you’re actually missing out on what the Almighty has in store for you. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in the current situation. But you must stay firm in faith. Know that you are not alone. He’s watching our moves and how we cope! Help is very near!"
1817,2020-04-02 04:23:00+00:00,muftimenk,"What have we learnt from this outbreak? That there are still many good people out there; we have not lost touch with humanity &amp; we’re all trying to cope in the best way we can. But it has also shown up cracks in our society. Hoarding, panic buying etc. Let us mend our ways!"
1818,2020-04-01 21:58:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you can’t see a way doesn’t mean there’s no way. The Almighty is working behind the scenes and we need only to trust Him, have faith, keep doing what we must and He will do the rest. Remember, what is impossible with man is possible with Him. Never lose faith!"
1819,2020-04-01 13:43:08+00:00,muftimenk,"With most of us housebound and with family or flatmates, nerves are bound to snap. Be mindful of your present situation and environment. Learn to stay calm and get on with your own activities. Let others do theirs. Resist the urge to get involved in other people’s affairs!"
1820,2020-04-01 05:10:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Usually on the 1st of April, we won't be able to tell fact from fable. But today, I strongly believe that we should be responsible. I urge you NOT to mislead people, cause panic, instil a sense of false hope or fear and later claim that we were fooling around!"
1821,2020-03-31 23:23:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Never lose hope in what the Almighty can do. You may be uncertain, confused, unsure &amp; even fearful. But refuse to give fear the power it needs to consume us. Faith and fear don’t go hand in hand. We firmly believe in Him alone. He has our back not only today but everyday!"
1822,2020-03-31 12:25:19+00:00,muftimenk,"We may be surprised by the turn  of events in our lives but nothing that happens is a surprise to the Almighty. He knows everything to the minutest detail. He has planned it all. We need to embrace each day in the best possible way, knowing that He has our backs always!"
1823,2020-03-31 00:12:27+00:00,muftimenk,Lay your trust in the Almighty and rely on Him by all means but you must play your part! Do your level best and let Him take over. It’s natural to feel anxious in this fast-paced world but it can be managed well if we confide in Him often. He is the Owner of all solutions!
1824,2020-03-30 13:36:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Things can happen at the drop of a hat! We’ve seen that lately! There’s so much to be done &amp; there’s too little time. Remember, tomorrow is not promised to anyone. Seize today. Prioritise your activities. Make an impact. Leave a mark. Life’s too short to be doing otherwise!"
1825,2020-03-30 04:43:38+00:00,muftimenk,Panic-scrolling through the news on social media can be counterproductive. Social distancing has us stuck in our homes &amp; most of us are trying to keep up with the avalanche of information coming out each day. Perhaps it’s time to quarantine social media for several hours daily?
1826,2020-03-29 23:18:11+00:00,muftimenk,We’re living in unprecedented times. What I’m writing now will likely be out of date tomorrow.  The scale of what’s happening is hard to grasp. Only the Almighty with His Divine Wisdom knows the answer. We have to get used to this new norm. Get closer to the One who’s in control!
1827,2020-03-29 08:09:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Social distancing may be the new buzzword but that hasn’t dampened community spirit in this pandemic. We hear stories how humanity is so much alive, with people showing love &amp; kindness all round.  Remember to be kind always because such acts spread faster than any virus!"
1828,2020-03-28 18:40:21+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We pray for the many families &amp; business owners facing financial stress. It can be scary &amp; overwhelming not knowing how bills &amp; obligations will be met or to not be able to provide for loved ones. Grant them comfort &amp; ease knowing that You’re the Owner of Sustenance!
1829,2020-03-28 06:15:17+00:00,muftimenk,Our blessings may not be so obvious sometimes. It may come in an unpalatable way. Don’t be upset. Embrace the suffering with beautiful patience. Thank Him for everything that He has bestowed on us. Things will become clearer soon. Trust the process.
1830,2020-03-27 22:27:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. As more become infected with the virus, healthcare workers &amp; medical staff worldwide are working longer hours with higher risk of contracting the disease themselves. Protect them, grant them strength and sustain them in their call of duty. Help them to stay safe!"
1831,2020-03-27 08:59:02+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to put a halt to the spread of the virus. May we be sensible during this difficult period &amp; learn to be compassionate &amp; empathize with everyone because it has become a global problem. May we use this time in isolation to reflect on our link with You. Aameen!
1832,2020-03-26 19:04:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Every now and then your faith will be tested. Don’t expect everything to be smooth all the time. You will panic. You will be fearful. But at the end of the day, you must believe that you will make it. Why? Because the Almighty has promised He won’t test us beyond our capacity!"
1833,2020-03-26 12:37:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Life doesn’t look back. It just carries on, with or without you. Be prepared for whatever comes your way. When you least expect it, it will test you &amp; challenge you. How you respond will set the tone for the rest of your life. Don’t take things for granted. Be on your guard."
1834,2020-03-25 23:03:11+00:00,muftimenk,Use your time alone in isolation to purify yourself and refine your faith. It’s a good time to clean up the heart from diseases that have bogged you down and prevented you from moving forward. Learn to appreciate one another so you can support one another in good &amp; bad times.
1835,2020-03-25 15:25:52+00:00,muftimenk,"We have no words to describe our gratitude to those on the frontline besides a prayer to the Almighty for all of you and your loved ones.

May the Almighty be with you and grant you the best recompense! Aameen https://t.co/KsgqZ8zIvF"
1836,2020-03-25 13:36:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let your current situation define you. We’re all in the same boat. Be kind to all you meet. People have lost loved ones, their jobs, financial security etc as a result of the virus. Use this time to take stock of your life &amp; where you’re headed. Use it to purify yourself!"
1837,2020-03-25 09:56:15+00:00,muftimenk,This does not replace seeking professional medical attention. It is simply to help boost the immune system and deal with symptoms while waiting for the overstretched medical staff to attend to you.
1838,2020-03-25 09:40:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Taken from authentic teachings of Prophet Muhammad pbuh, the Black Seed Oil or Nigella Sativa Virgin Oil, has definitely helped those with symptoms.

Don't forget to keep hydrated, do warm salt water gargles, have Vitamin C, D &amp; Zinc supplements and  some non animal protein. https://t.co/kO0lf2kg26"
1839,2020-03-24 18:42:13+00:00,muftimenk,Practise good hygiene &amp; social distancing. Do what’s right in this current climate. Numbers are rising. Governments are taking drastic measures trying to contain the spread. Let’s do our best. #Covid_19 can be a blessing if it draws you closer to your Maker. The choice is yours!
1840,2020-03-24 16:29:51+00:00,muftimenk,"We're in it together! - Mufti Menk

https://t.co/GpaBnCrtku"
1841,2020-03-24 04:46:25+00:00,muftimenk,"We’re living in testing times. Isn’t it amazing how man is always making plans for his life. Some of us have even made plans for the entire year! In one fell swoop, the Almighty has shown the world His Prowess. Plans have had to be changed, adjusted or even cancelled!"
1842,2020-03-24 00:08:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep calling out to the Almighty. Ask for forgiveness, for mercy not just for yourself but for family &amp; loved ones. All such acts are forms of worship &amp; they carry great reward. Isn’t that simply beautiful? Just for asking, you’re rewarded. Call on Him sincerely. He will respond!"
1843,2020-03-23 10:54:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Change can happen as quickly or as slowly as the person so chooses. A crisis like the #coronavirus outbreak can be a catalyst for change.

Emotionally. Don’t cave in. Difficult days are ahead. Draw closer to the Almighty. He’s the only One who can get us through this!
1845,2020-03-21 22:42:09+00:00,muftimenk,"There are still people who aren’t taking this #coronavirus outbreak seriously. Remember, it’s not just about you. Spare a thought for family &amp; loved ones, especially the elderly. You may be young &amp; healthy but there are those whose immune system is compromised. Don’t be selfish!"
1846,2020-03-21 13:11:51+00:00,muftimenk,Now is the time to get closer to the Almighty. Commit yourself to depend on Him and repent to Him. Speak to Him about your woes and fears and anxieties. He will shine a light in your darkness. Don’t worry. Don’t fret. He knows what’s going on. Stay connected to Him always!
1847,2020-03-20 22:01:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop overthinking. The coronavirus is a test! This test will expose how true we are to our faith! Sadly, we’re failing. Look at the hoarding, the panic buying etc. We’re supposed to want for others what we want for ourselves. We're supposed to be drawing closer to the Almighty!"
1848,2020-03-20 10:49:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Now is the time to show you truly care about humanity. Remember, it’s not all about you. Be of help to the people you care about; family, friends, neighbours, the elderly, the aged, the homeless. The list is endless. Find it in your heart to give generously whatever you can!"
1849,2020-03-20 04:59:58+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Forgive our sins &amp; grant us ease in this time of distress &amp; anxiety. We ask You to stop the spread of #coronavirus that’s taken the world by storm. Grant healing &amp; comfort to those who’ve been infected. Give us a strong sense of social responsibility to do what’s right!

1851,2020-03-19 07:45:49+00:00,muftimenk,The isolation many have to undergo can only be a good thing. It’s an excellent way to protect our faith &amp; to safeguard us during these confusing times. We always want more time for ourselves &amp; family so use this period wisely. Mind your own business; keep out of harm’s way!
1852,2020-03-18 22:39:21+00:00,muftimenk,A #virus that is invisible to the naked eye is causing mayhem worldwide. Everyone is feeling a sense of unease. It’s not business as usual. We have to get used to a new norm for a while. Ask the Almighty for strength so that we can remain patient as we face the coming days!
1853,2020-03-18 15:19:38+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re on quarantine, resist the urge to waste time. If you’re glued to social media amidst this #corona #outbteak you need to put things in perspective. It’s NOT business as usual! There may be a global crisis but internally your link with the Almighty shouldn’t be in crisis!"
1854,2020-03-17 17:47:44+00:00,muftimenk,"As more countries go into #lockdown people are having to grapple with a host of emotions. The fear, the uncertainty, the loneliness , the helplessness. Don’t despair. #covid19 may be spreading like wildfire but the Almighty’s in total control! He knows what we’re going through!"
1855,2020-03-17 10:42:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s face it. We fight battles daily. No one knows about them except the Almighty. Never forget that He is All-Knowing and He can help all. There is no pain or struggle that He is not aware of. He never ignores your pain. Remember, you’re not alone, even on your darkest days!"
1856,2020-03-16 20:37:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Protect your inner peace and all the emotions that go with it. It’s important for your overall well-being.

1857,2020-03-16 07:57:40+00:00,muftimenk,Social responsibility has become even more important in this #coronavirus outbreak. It’s  not all about you. Cultivate good habits not just for yourself but with others in mind. Take social distancing seriously. Be concerned about physical &amp; health safety for yourself &amp; others!
1858,2020-03-16 03:28:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t take the #coronavirus outbreak lightly. Preventing its spread is an obligation. Take all necessary steps &amp; precaution towards this end.

1861,2020-03-15 09:08:59+00:00,muftimenk,Your friends play an important role in your life. Be careful who you get close to because you start becoming like them. Your thoughts ideas and actions mimic your friends. It can be the most rewarding experience or the most difficult one. It’s your choice. Do it wisely!
1862,2020-03-15 01:05:45+00:00,muftimenk,There’s no need to panic about #coronavirus but there’s a need to be intelligent &amp; take precautions. There’s so much information out there &amp; it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Keep it simple. The basics hold true. Stay alert &amp; vigilant. Look out for others. That’s the best way to be!
1863,2020-03-14 15:15:58+00:00,muftimenk,Let us change our thinking and go beyond merely treating others how we want to be treated. Think about others the way you’d want them to think of you. Feel for others the way you’d want them to feel about you. Speak to others the way you’d like them to speak to you! Try it today!
1864,2020-03-14 03:06:01+00:00,muftimenk,Everyone is going through a struggle. You have yours &amp; I have mine. Don’t hurt others with your words. Speak kindly or remain silent. Be sensitive to people’s feelings especially during this difficult period where everyone is anxious &amp; on edge. May the Almighty guide us always!
1865,2020-03-13 16:57:57+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t overthink. Don’t let little things bother you to such an extent that you find it hard to carry on in life. There’s a good reason why many people lose their composure when faced with small irritants. Identify yours and get hold of yourself before it spirals out of control!
1866,2020-03-12 23:07:28+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s so much going on around us today that it’s easy to focus on frustration, fatigue and irritations! Don’t! Take it one step at a time because the Almighty is in full control. Do your best. Surrender to His Decree. You will have enough energy to get through your day."
1867,2020-03-12 15:13:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Help us to stay calm amidst the fear, noise and chaos  all around us. We’re feeling anxious and overwhelmed by the mounting worries of life. It feels like everything is spinning out of control. Grant us ease and the ability to refocus on what truly matters. Aameen!"
1868,2020-03-12 06:50:53+00:00,muftimenk,Stop comparing yourself with others. Recognise and appreciate what the Almighty has blessed you with for your journey. You’re special and no one else is like you. He’s tailor made exactly what you need because He knows you better than you know yourself. Be grateful always!
1869,2020-03-11 18:48:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Get rid of that pride in your heart. Picture yourself lying in your grave, would any of this matter? Let go of diseases of the heart, one by one. It takes a concerted effort. It won’t happen overnight. But if you’re serious, it can &amp; will happen! Seek your strength from Him."
1870,2020-03-11 05:27:17+00:00,muftimenk,There’ll be times in our lives where the Almighty will allow us to go through things that we don't understand. We must trust that there is a purpose behind His plan. That’s faith. Always believe that He wants the best for us. He will work things out eventually! Without a doubt!
1871,2020-03-10 22:24:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste time. Don’t put off till tomorrow what you should be doing today. Life is short. Death awaits us. Do as many good deeds as possible before our time is up. Yesterday can never be tomorrow. Don’t listen to Satan. If he can’t make you sin, he will make you waste time!"
1872,2020-03-10 07:12:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you haven’t got it all figured out, you’re NOT a failure. Learn to take things in your stride. Don’t get impatient when you see others achieving their goals. Your timing is your timing. Keep giving your best! The Almighty has it all worked out. Trust His Wisdom!"
1873,2020-03-09 16:51:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Who are among the strongest? Those who make time to help others, even when they’re struggling with their own issues. Life is about service to others. Each day, we’re preoccupied with ourselves &amp; our selfish needs. Start reaching out to others &amp; see how life is transformed!"
1874,2020-03-09 09:37:27+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty never told us that this life would be all sunshine and rainbows. We’re here to be tested. The world will bring you down to your knees often. It will keep you there if you allow it. Don’t! Get right up. Keep going the way He has prescribed for us. Remain steadfast!
1875,2020-03-08 18:13:26+00:00,muftimenk,The bottom line is you really can’t count on people to motivate &amp; build you up in life. The truth is everyone is so caught up in  their own lives that they have little or no time for others. Learn to encourage yourself but remember not to leave the Almighty out of the equation!
1876,2020-03-08 06:22:43+00:00,muftimenk,"You are what you feed your mind. Today we suffer from TMI! Too much information or information overload. Remember, your mental diet is just as important as your food intake. Thoughts are powerful food for your mind. What you believe, you become. So think positive thoughts!"
1877,2020-03-07 14:20:24+00:00,muftimenk,"The life lessons sent your way are never wasted. The Almighty doesn’t waste anything. He has a reason &amp; purpose for everything that happens in your life.

1878,2020-03-07 08:11:45+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty will pave the way for you to meet many people during your lifetime. Some will be past reflections of a repeated  cycle you’ve experience in your life. Others will steer you towards a new start. That’s why it’s important to attract the right people into your life!
1879,2020-03-07 01:23:20+00:00,muftimenk,Be aware of how you speak to people. You may come across as trying to one up the other person in many ways with a more powerful story than theirs. Pay attention to such things. It shows you care about what they’re saying; that you’re not just trying to push your own agenda!

You’ll end up miserable &amp; disillusioned with life. Be happy for others. Congratulate their success &amp; send out lots of positive energy! It will all come back to you!"

1883,2020-03-06 07:50:49+00:00,muftimenk,Social media is full of smoke &amp; mirrors; people inventing a life they don’t actually live. It’s becoming harder to tell who’s real &amp; who’s fake because there are so many on the platform. Life is not meant to be a burden of always trying to impress others &amp; put on a mask! Live!
1884,2020-03-06 00:17:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We pray for everyone across the globe, for safety as well as comfort amidst uncertainty and crisis. We ask for Your guidance and direction.

1886,2020-03-04 19:53:10+00:00,muftimenk,"When something bad happens, you either bear patience or panic. By enduring &amp; bearing patience, you earn a great reward &amp; accept the will &amp; decree of the Almighty. But if you react with anger &amp; worry, you’re forgetting who is in complete control of every aspect of your existence!"
1887,2020-03-04 09:05:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan will cause you grief &amp; stress. When you keep having negative thoughts of pain &amp; sorrow, he will worsen your condition. So get a perspective on life. Remember, this world is a mix of ease &amp; hardship, joy &amp; sorrow, hope &amp; pain. Do your best to adopt a positive mindest!"

1889,2020-03-04 01:51:06+00:00,muftimenk,"We need to stop complaining about what goes on in our lives. Every storm was designed to make us stronger, because all things that come from the Almighty always work together for our good.There are others who are struggling way more than we could ever imagine. Pray for them!"
1890,2020-03-03 15:42:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t get arrogant and think that you did it all on your own. Nothing can be achieved without the Almighty’s Will. Remember, it’s not your talent but His Mercy. It’s not your hard work but His Blessing. It’s not your knowledge but His Wisdom. So be humble and thank Him profusely!"
1891,2020-03-03 05:10:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Why is it so hard to rejoice when the Almighty blesses others? Many of us will think, why didn’t He bless me like that? Stop! When we’re not happy for those who have been blessed, it shows a lack of griatitufe for all that He has done for us. Learn to be gracious and generous!"
1892,2020-03-02 20:55:11+00:00,muftimenk,"We are all on separate journeys but heading towards the same  destination! We just need to stay in our own lanes. Trust in yourself, trust that you are doing the best you can, no matter what life throws at you. Always believe that the Almighty wants the best for you! Keep going!"
1893,2020-03-02 13:27:46+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve done something wrong... Don’t try to shift the blame. Don’t run from your mistakes. Don’t try to pass the burden of your mistakes. Don’t make a mistake worse by not owning it, by trying to sweep it under the carpet or pass it onto someone else’s shoulders!"
1894,2020-03-02 05:42:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t allow anything to break you. Things can test you as they often do. But no matter how hard you fall, get back up &amp; start over. That’s the mark of an achiever. Giving up is not an option. No amount of pressure can stop the energy within. You’re resilient. You’re worth it!"
1895,2020-03-01 19:50:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When everything seems to grind to a halt and you start thinking that you’re a loser, think again.  Is there any limit to the Almighty’s Prowess? He’s the Lord of the Worlds. Did He not bring you this far? Do you think He will abandon you now? Trust Him, nothing is impossible!"
1896,2020-03-01 14:57:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you get anxious often? Wondering what’s to come, worrying about the future. Sometimes you feel at peace, the next moment you’re panicking, having palpitations. You need to start focusing on the Almighty, trusting His plans for you. You need to know that He has your back!"
1897,2020-03-01 06:41:19+00:00,muftimenk,You’ll never be short of critics. It’s made even more challenging in our digital world because most of them are anonymous. Learn to take criticisms in your stride. You don’t have to respond to everyone. Sort the constructive from the destructive. Never compromise your self-worth!
1898,2020-02-29 12:34:15+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty closes your door, none can open it besides Him. And when he opens your door, none can close it besides Him. His timing is always perfect. Don't underestimate His Power, Wisdom &amp; Mercy. Turn to Him at all times. Good &amp; bad. Trust Him for He knows best!"
1899,2020-02-29 11:12:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep praying for patience &amp; contentment. We live in such a materialistic world that it can be hard to resist what we see around us. Don’t be tempted to have the latest in everything; fashion, electronic gadgets &amp; smart devices, cars etc. Spend that money on a good cause instead!"
1900,2020-02-28 21:46:30+00:00,muftimenk,It’s easy to post a comment on social media without giving it much thought. It only takes a few seconds. Just like texting. It’s easy to make a sarcastic remark or make fun of someone with your words. Words can reduce a person’s self-esteem in an instant! Watch your words!
1901,2020-02-28 16:29:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Bend but don’t break. You might think it’s easy to say but so hard to do. The bending part of life is what redefines human capacity. You’re more resilient than you think you are. Remember, the Almighty will not burden us with that which we have no ability to bear!"
1902,2020-02-28 12:36:29+00:00,muftimenk,Social media fatigue is real. It affects people in more ways than you can imagine. Is your smartphone the first thing you look for when you wake? Are you spending time on too many social media sites engaging your followers and interacting with them on everything under the sun?
1903,2020-02-28 06:35:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Many of us need healing from past hurts &amp; events that have left us totally broken. Replace our pain, weakness &amp; sorrow with comfort.  We know You can heal us in a heartbeat. Grant ease to our hearts so we can be strong again. Heal our soul &amp; make us whole once more!"
1904,2020-02-27 14:42:07+00:00,muftimenk,Spend some time each day reflecting on what you’re putting into your book of deeds. We have a merciful Lord where our bad deeds can still be erased after we’ve committed them. All it needs is sincere repentance. Don’t delay. Don’t despair. Make it a book you’ll be proud of!
1905,2020-02-27 08:17:48+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age where people are conditioned to look ‘perfect’, have the courage to be yourself. Be you, be real and not fake things about yourself just to fit into society’s image. Be authentic, be sincere and the Almighty will open doors for you which you never imagined before."
1906,2020-02-26 22:02:31+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty knows our struggles. He has seen the tears and heard our prayers. The best we can hope for is to believe that relief is near. Very near. He has promised us. Remember, whatever suffering &amp; sorrows we have now, will be forgotten once we lay our eyes on Paradise!"

1908,2020-02-26 15:26:23+00:00,muftimenk,"It can be easy to get caught up in the affairs of the world and forget to stop and show our  appreciation for what we have in this life. The Almighty is the most generous &amp; yet we tend to take things for granted. Remember, a life well lived is one of gratitude and thankfulness!"
1909,2020-02-26 09:04:07+00:00,muftimenk,"We all have problems. But when you overthink your situation, it becomes unhealthy. Make an effort to not dwell on past events. Repeating in your mind negative experiences, asking “why me?” could end up with greater suffering. Focus on the positives to offset your worries!"
1910,2020-02-26 01:12:41+00:00,muftimenk,"The more confident you are, the quieter you become. Confidence whispers, insecurity roars. Confident people are not attention seekers. Their mere presence is loud enough for the world to see. Contrarily, the insecure ones are the loudest, drawing most attention to themselves."
1911,2020-02-25 19:09:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't speak negatively about your spouse to others; including friends &amp; family! By doing so you’re destroying the life within your relationship. You’re inviting Satan to dwell on the negatives. Even if your spouse has done wrong, speak to him/her privately, not to a third party!"
1912,2020-02-25 04:50:11+00:00,muftimenk,"People are so caught up with trends these days. Let’s be trendsetters of a different kind. Don’t judge, be understanding instead. Don’t shame &amp; expose. Choose compassion &amp; empathy. Don’t hurt, be kind and helpful always. Make a conscious effort to do things differently!"
1913,2020-02-24 20:19:11+00:00,muftimenk,Social media envy is real. It’s fuelled by the fact that people share only their finest moments as if the whole aim of their social media presence is to inspire envy. It’s dangerous. Let’s try and keep it real. Don’t be shallow and materialistic. Get busy with real life instead!
1914,2020-02-24 13:59:38+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how harsh life gets, you remember the beautiful things the Almighty has promised you. That’s true patience. You keep enduring no matter how terrible you feel inside because you know it won’t last. You never inflict pain on others or let it affect how you treat them."
1915,2020-02-24 03:02:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Respect other people’s time.  Your time, your needs, your demands are just as valuable as theirs. Exercise discretion on deadlines &amp; requests. It doesn’t take much to train yourself to be respectful of other people’s time, after all, wouldn’t you want them to do the same for you?"
1916,2020-02-23 15:38:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t ask the Almighty for something and then complain about what follows. If you want to achieve your goals, you have to go through setbacks, failure, diversions; but these don’t last. Nothing does actually. So don’t make permanent decisions based on temporary situations!"
1917,2020-02-23 00:54:44+00:00,muftimenk,Do you want inner peace &amp; serenity? Focus on the Almighty. Make Him a part of your life. Daily. Not just when calamity strikes. Nothing else will give you that much eluded feeling which many are searching for in everything worldly. You’ll achieve a sense of peace like no other!
1918,2020-02-22 07:33:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyday, make a concerted effort to replace negative thoughts from your mind with positive ones. May the overthinking &amp; pessimism exit your mind. May clarity replace confusion. May peace and serenity reign in your heart. Do this diligently and you’ll be ready for more blessings!"
1919,2020-02-22 00:50:09+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re doing well, expect negative criticisms. Use that as a signal to recommit to your work; refocus on the road ahead. Some people are determined to take things personally &amp; tear down the work of others. Your life’s too short to worry about pleasing those difficult people!"
1920,2020-02-21 15:50:25+00:00,muftimenk,"The world doesn’t need to know everything. If you want to give, give. If you want to help, help. There’s no need to make a song &amp; dance about it. The amazing is often found in the anonymous. It’s often the ones working tirelessly in the background who are the most selfless!"
1921,2020-02-21 08:17:10+00:00,muftimenk,"How you deal with things says a lot about you. Being calm when there’s chaos doesn’t happen overnight. It comes when you have full trust in the Almighty. Instead of overthinking and overreacting, you just hand over everything to Him after you’ve given your best shot at things."
1922,2020-02-21 00:08:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. When things don’t work out the way we want or expect, help us to be contented. May we embrace whatever happens in good spirit. Let us focus on having a positive mindset because You are All-Knowing. You’re the most powerful and You’re in control of our destiny. Aameen!"
1923,2020-02-20 18:20:42+00:00,muftimenk,"In this stressful life of ours, we tend to take people for granted. Don’t! No matter how nice people are, remember everyone has their limits. Don’t cross that limit.  Don’t make unrealistic demands on others because one day, they  will snap! Don’t forget we are human after all!"
1924,2020-02-20 11:08:03+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve wronged someone, don’t try to turn the tables &amp; make yourself the wronged party. You may think you’re getting away with it but the Almighty knows the whole story. In fact, you should be afraid because when it all comes back to you, the truth will out. He knows best!"
1925,2020-02-19 17:12:11+00:00,muftimenk,"When we face the storms of life, do we bear beautiful patience, anchor our roots deeper or do we waver and get knocked down? That’s why it’s important to keep drawing closer to the Almighty in good times so when bad times come, He will see us through!"
1926,2020-02-19 08:58:29+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be a control freak. Don’t micromanage. Embrace uncertainty because that’s part of life. Plan meticulously by all means but trying to be in control every step of the way is unhealthy. The Almighty is the best planner. He will steer things in the right direction for you!
1927,2020-02-18 21:42:47+00:00,muftimenk,"We’re all imperfect, serving a perfect Creator who’s most Merciful. He doesn’t expect perfection from us. All He wants is for us to try &amp; do our best. Are we giving our best? He knows what’s in the hearts &amp; He knows us better than we know ourselves. So let’s get our act together!"
1928,2020-02-18 07:26:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Being kind costs nothing. Kind acts and kind words will go a long way to put someone back on their feet. They have the power to give strength, motivate, boost self-esteem and increase confidence. What’s holding you back? Remember, in a world where you can be anything, be kind!"
1929,2020-02-17 23:22:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you on the verge of giving up? Don’t! Stay patient for a while longer. The Almighty wants you to know that the battle is not over. Remember, it’s darkest before dawn. He works miracles. Trust Him because He has not stopped working in your favour."
1930,2020-02-17 16:01:34+00:00,muftimenk,People can’t stand it when someone else is doing well. They'll try to plant seeds of doubt &amp; negativity. They may even spread falsehoods just to hijack your success story. Don’t worry about their plans. The Almighty is fully aware &amp; All-Knowing. Trust Him to pave your journey!
1931,2020-02-17 08:40:42+00:00,muftimenk,What will you be known for when you leave this earth? Have you given it a thought? Start by being kind; spread goodness wherever you go. One of the best ways to be remembered is to touch people’s hearts with acts of kindness.Your legacy is the story there’ll share about you!
1932,2020-02-17 00:56:09+00:00,muftimenk,"There are many out there who need direction. They’re lost or simply in a state of limbo waiting for something to happen. As much as you can do your part, remember that guidance comes from the Almighty. Commit yourself totally to Him and trust Him to unfold a good plan for you!"
1933,2020-02-16 18:22:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Let’s be honest. We all worry. We do it daily. But let us not stress ourselves by worrying about things which are beyond our control. The Almighty knows every single aspect of our lives. He has equipped us well to face life challenges. Patience, gratitude &amp; trust. Embrace them!"
1934,2020-02-16 05:51:03+00:00,muftimenk,You may not be in a place where you’d like to be right now but know that this is part of your life journey. You have to overcome this before moving to the next level. It’s part of the Almighty’s Plan. So embrace the journey knowing that nothing lasts. Bear patience! Trust Him!
1935,2020-02-15 21:50:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about people having ill intent towards you. Protect yourself the best way you can but remember there’s no might greater than the Almighty. When He protects you, no one can touch you. Never lose that link with Him. Always seek protection from Him and Him Alone."
1936,2020-02-15 09:39:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t complicate life. What you give, you get. Even when your actions are not reciprocated, keep doing good. Why? Because the Almighty loves those who do good. Life’s too short to be doing otherwise. You’ll fail, you’ll feel lost but if you keep Him in focus, you’ll be fine!"
1937,2020-02-15 03:50:10+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s a misconception to think that you need to turn your life around before you can start praying &amp; getting close to the Almighty. No! Start worshipping Him amid the mess &amp; chaos around you. Don’t let Satan tell you otherwise. No matter what’s going on in your life, pray!"
1938,2020-02-14 21:18:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Understand the plan of the Almighty. He’s going to test your character. Are you paying lip service to your faith? He will send challenges in many forms. Your wealth, your children, people you mix around with etc. He will look at your heart. If you’re sincere, you’ll succeed!"
1939,2020-02-14 15:54:17+00:00,muftimenk,"You’ll encounter difficult people in life. It’s always about them. They’ll drain your energy rather than uplift you. They make it their job to see what’s wrong rather than what’s right. Be kind. Give them a listening ear. Try &amp; be reasonable. If it doesn’t work, don’t feel bad!"
1940,2020-02-14 04:42:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us comfort amid the hardships we’re facing. Give us the strength &amp; resilience to weather the storms passing by. We know You’re with us and though we are overwhelmed at times, we are not in despair. Make us content and humble as we lay our full trust in You!"
1941,2020-02-13 20:52:49+00:00,muftimenk,You worked hard but didn’t get promoted. You love her but she married someone else. You think life’s unfair! No. It’s wishful thinking. The reality is that the Almighty is protecting you from things that will happen in future which you can’t foresee! Learn to accept His Decree!
1942,2020-02-13 11:11:58+00:00,muftimenk,Live life one day at a time. Focus on making it the best day. There’s so much uncertainty &amp; chaos around us; it’s easy to get sucked into the fray. Don’t. Maintain your peace. Take it in your stride. Trust the Almighty. It makes no sense to worry because worry changes nothing.
1943,2020-02-13 04:27:03+00:00,muftimenk,Do you sometimes feel like you take two steps forward but fall back by one step? This happens to the best of us. Success is not a linear progression. Many things can hold you back. The point is to not let setbacks deter you from achieving your goal. Keep going. You’ll get there!
1944,2020-02-12 17:10:56+00:00,muftimenk,Man is often ungrateful; always focusing on what’s not going right. Why? There are so many things we need to thank the Almighty for &amp; yet we get stuck in this “what’s lacking in my life mode!” Change the mindset. Don’t miss out on His abundant blessings! Gratitude is key!
1945,2020-02-12 06:58:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop complaining &amp; start living. Whenever you’re tempted to complain, look at the suffering around you. It’s a wake up call to be grateful for all that the Almighty has blessed you with. To complain when we have so much going for us is a downright insult to the real sufferers!"
1946,2020-02-11 22:08:41+00:00,muftimenk,Many of us are hesitant to do kind acts because we’re always waiting for that perfect moment. There’s no such thing. Anytime is perfect for you to do good &amp; spread kindness. The Almighty’s not looking for perfection. He’s interested in your heart &amp; intent. That’s the reward!
1947,2020-02-11 09:51:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Fame is a double-edged sword. Not many can handle it. Tamper it with reality, you should be fine. Let it get to your head, it could spell trouble! Arrogance &amp; ego come into play. You may end up a different person! It’s a test from the Almighty. He’s watching your moves!"
1948,2020-02-10 20:11:24+00:00,muftimenk,"One of the best ways to get through life is to change the way we respond to things. It’s all about perspective and our attitude towards things. While we do not have control over everything that happens in our lives, we do have control over how we allow things to affect us!"
1949,2020-02-10 12:58:36+00:00,muftimenk,Remember that you do not make yourself look better by making someone else look worse. You do not appear more pious by implying that others are less pious. Don’t ever go that route. Just focus on yourself and let people do what they have to do. The Almighty is the Best Judge!
1950,2020-02-10 04:35:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Negativity gets you nowhere. If you’re holding on to negative thoughts, you’ll always be struggling and feeling low. Delete those negative thoughts and choose a positive mindset. No one determines your destiny but the Almighty. Don’t let anyone plant any such thoughts in you!"
1951,2020-02-09 09:13:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When things aren’t going well, it’s easy to sink into depths of despair &amp; allow Satan to cloud your mind. Resist it! Rise above it, shake yourself free; dry your tears. Refocus your energy &amp; reclaim your faith. The Almighty’s waiting for you. You’ll succeed in spite of it all!"
1952,2020-02-08 21:52:29+00:00,muftimenk,"When you fail at something, it’s a test from the Almighty. It shouldn’t stop you. If you don’t succeed, try again. The biggest mistake is to give up. He’s watching to see how hard you’re trying, how badly you really want it. For every obstacle, there’s a solution! Keep at it!"
1953,2020-02-08 13:24:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Beat that move! 😊😊

1954,2020-02-08 13:03:39+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re unsure, unsettled and confused over a situation, turn to the Almighty for ease. Trust Him for a way out; in fact the best solution from the best of planners. He will direct your steps; be your compass and guide you through it. Peace will reign again  in your heart!"
1955,2020-02-08 00:32:06+00:00,muftimenk,Faith over fear. That’s what we need in this confusing time. We hear so much &amp; often suffer from information overload. What fraction of it is real? Be discerning &amp; informed. Don’t just believe everything you hear. Challenges &amp; uncertainties will come. Trust the Almighty always!
1956,2020-02-07 17:26:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t take life for granted. Here today, gone tomorrow is indeed real! Many of us have seen it happen to our loved ones and close friends. We never know when our time will be up. So forgive, spread goodness and pray that the Almighty takes us when He is most pleased with us!"
1957,2020-02-07 09:59:50+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t apologize for taking time out for yourself. You’re human! Self-care should not be neglected. How can you continue to give and do your best if you’re in a bad state. Learn to say no when you have to without explaining yourself. Those who appreciate you will understand!
1958,2020-02-07 04:59:57+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant us comfort and strength during these times of crisis and chaos the world over. Surround us with clarity and light amid the upheaval. We know You are with us and would never forsake us. Help us to keep the peace in our hearts which can only come from You! Aameen.
1959,2020-02-06 22:06:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fret if your efforts don’t receive much or any recognition or publicity. Know that the Almighty’s protecting your sincerity &amp; work from corruption. Most importantly, remember, He loves those deeds that are small &amp; consistent. They are the most beneficial in the long run."
1960,2020-02-06 08:25:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Always pray for a good ending. 
Oftentimes we are obsessed with the goings-on around us that we forget what our purpose is! Where are we headed? The journey is important. But ultimately what happens in the end is what matters most. Many start well but few will finish strong!"
1961,2020-02-06 03:05:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Wake each morning thanking the Almighty because no one knows what each day may bring. No matter what’s going on in our lives, show utmost gratitude. A new day is a gift, a blessing from Him. Not everyone gets it. Some had huge plans for today but didn’t wake up! So thank Him!"
1962,2020-02-05 17:00:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Have you been waiting for a while? Waiting for your test to be over; for the Almighty to grant ease; for the bad moments to fade. Waiting is about patience. Patience leads to success. It’s not easy; not for the faint hearted. It’s based on sincerity &amp; prayer, wisdom &amp; hope!"
1963,2020-02-05 06:06:25+00:00,muftimenk,What we see as mistakes can actually be a turning point. The Almighty can turn the mistake into a huge blessing. It’s up to you to see it or are you too busy wallowing in self-pity?  Don’t beat yourself up for the mistakes you've made. Use them to propel you to the next level!
1964,2020-02-04 23:09:58+00:00,muftimenk,"What people think of you doesn’t matter. In this social media age we’re fixated on perception; it’s all about what people think of us, how they view us, their approval etc. Take a step back. It’s the Almighty’s approval we need. If He’s pleased with us, nothing else matters!"
1965,2020-02-04 16:39:40+00:00,muftimenk,Never give up when the going gets tough. Never quit at the first sign of difficulty. Life was never meant to be easy; it’s a constant struggle with lows and highs. The times when it’s most important to persevere are the times that you will be most tested. Keep going. Trust Him!
1966,2020-02-04 04:13:08+00:00,muftimenk,Remember that life is not a sprint but a marathon. The race is not for the fastest nor the strongest who can flex his muscles but for those who will run at a steady pace till the end. With utmost endurance and patience. The ultimate test of your faith. Do you have what it takes?
1967,2020-02-03 19:25:31+00:00,muftimenk,"When you ask the Almighty for something, ask with confidence. Ask with positivity. He always hears and knows what is best for you. If what He gave you seemed like a NO to your request, understand that He has something much better in store. Embrace what you have and look ahead!"
1968,2020-02-03 05:07:00+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone is hurtful or racist towards you, don’t reciprocate. It doesn’t give you the green light to behave the same towards them.  Don’t let the ugliness of someone else’s character change who you are.  Remember that ugliness is a reflection of their character. Not yours!"
1969,2020-02-02 20:07:39+00:00,muftimenk,Life isn't about who you once were. It's about who you are &amp; have the potential to be! Everyone has a past. So don’t worry about those who keep bringing up your past. Don't let such talk deter you from looking ahead with positivity. Seek your strength from the Almighty!
1970,2020-02-02 03:46:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember that words like impossible, unheard of, unthinkable, unknown, unseen, and unexpected don’t mean anything to the Almighty. He can make everything happen at the drop of a hat. Your task is to do your best and trust Him completely with your life. You will be unstoppable!"
1971,2020-02-01 16:56:24+00:00,muftimenk,"So the Almighty doesn’t give you what you’ve been asking for and you think He doesn’t love you. Never think that way of Him because He knows what you don’t! He could be saving you from a calamity. Unanswered prayers can be your greatest blessings. Have faith, trust Him always!"
1972,2020-02-01 08:03:11+00:00,muftimenk,Let’s face it. You are not going to wake up every morning feeling like you can conquer the world. That’s ok. But don’t quit. Those “low” days are crucial in your development. The Almighty will see you through. Place your firm belief and trust in Him. Your load  will lighten.

1974,2020-01-31 20:17:12+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty puts different people in our lives for different reasons. No one is there by accident. Learn to identify the people He has placed in your life and be sensitive to the purpose they serve. Some won’t be there forever. There is a time, place and purpose for everything."
1975,2020-01-31 06:11:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Protect us from being leaking buckets; those who engage in bad deeds just after doing good acts of worship. May we not be among those who pray, fast and give charity but curse, swear, gossip and backbite without batting an eyelid. Help us stay away from  such behaviour."
1976,2020-01-30 16:39:46+00:00,muftimenk,"This is life. People will cause you pain, hurt you, put you down, make you feel bad about yourself, as if you’re the bad one! It’s how you react that will determine the outcome. They are powerless until you choose to empower them. Don’t give them that privilege."
1977,2020-01-30 08:50:31+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t behave as you please in front of your children. Words that come out of your mouth should never be swear words. They’ll pick it up in a heartbeat. Control the tongue &amp; your manners too. They’re more likely to follow your example than your advice. Show them the best way!
1978,2020-01-29 16:00:45+00:00,muftimenk,"When your heart is broken, you think you’ve reached the end of the road and you feel empty; be careful what you fill it with! Satan is an opportunist. He will cause doubt &amp; unleash evil thoughts; strive to block him out. Turn to the Almighty. Seek His help. Only He can heal you!"

1980,2020-01-29 06:28:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of your reaction to those who’ve wronged you. Two wrongs do not make a right. You can’t be mean, angry or bitter &amp; expect goodness in return. Don’t become obsessed with revenge. Let the Almighty handle it. Be the better, kinder person always. Rise above it all."
1981,2020-01-28 16:46:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t complicate your life. If you want something done, do it yourself if you can. If you want to change a bad habit, go for it. Don’t just talk about it. If something distresses you, get to the bottom of it. Above all, always keep the Almighty on your radar. You’ll get there!"
1982,2020-01-28 04:48:54+00:00,muftimenk,We’re becoming more  preoccupied with the worldly stuff that we forget death is inevitable. It can come anytime; yet we always think we have time on our side. Don’t be foolish. May we realize this sooner rather than later and not be among those filled with regret in our graves!
1983,2020-01-27 15:38:36+00:00,muftimenk,Do you go through life thinking you have so many problems to solve? Every little thing is an issue? You’re always complaining. You get irritated easily. Focusing on what isn’t going right is a sure way to attract more negativity. Count your blessings! Think positive thoughts!
1984,2020-01-27 06:38:28+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes the Almighty closes doors because it’s time to move on. The trouble is we may not see this. We keep knocking but nothing happens. He knows what He’s doing. He also knows that we won’t move unlesss He creates some discomfort for us! Change is not easy! Trust Him.
1985,2020-01-26 16:56:31+00:00,muftimenk,"In real life, no one has it all together. Don’t believe anyone who says he does. Sometimes life gets overwhelming but our faith carries us through. Giving up is not an option. Every single one of us is fighting an unseen battle, often hidden by a brave exterior. Be empathetic!"
1986,2020-01-26 10:00:31+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t live life thinking about the past. Learn from your mistakes and live to realise the full potential that the Almighty has blessed you with. The journey is important but the end is even more crucial. Pray for guidance and strength always. May He grant us the best outcome!
1987,2020-01-25 22:59:16+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t compare your marriage to what you see online. There will always be people who post pictures making it look like they’re having a better time than you and your spouse! Avoid the temptation to make a comparison. Envy is dangerous. Disastrous even; so stay offline if you must!
1988,2020-01-25 14:24:59+00:00,muftimenk,We may get too dependent on people in our lives till we forget that the Almighty’s the only One in complete control of our existence. So He removes people from our lives for our own protection. Not everyone will like you. Not everyone wants good for you! Depend on Him alone!
1989,2020-01-25 06:11:31+00:00,muftimenk,It’s sad how some people are so jealous &amp; intimidated by you that they only have negative things to say when they know absolutely nothing about you. It’s common practice today; in fact it’s the norm. May the Almighty protect our tongues from saying things which harm others!
1990,2020-01-24 15:55:41+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let worry control you. That’s what Satan wants. He wants you to worry and live in doubt. Don’t let stress consume you too. Take things in your  stride. Think positive. Always look for solutions. Take a deep breath and know that the Almighty has it all worked out for you.
1991,2020-01-24 07:33:24+00:00,muftimenk,People love labels. They’ll use it loosely and indiscriminately on anyone and everyone. Don’t pay heed to any of that. How you think &amp; feel about yourself is determined by you. Don’t listen to the noise around you. Cut it out. Focus on your tasks ahead. A lot needs to be done.
1992,2020-01-23 23:00:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us the strength &amp; courage to stay firm &amp; hold on to our faith &amp; belief. Don’t make us among those who are people pleasers, losing ourselves in a crowd just because we want to fit in. Help us to worry less about what others think of us. Only You matter in the end!"
1993,2020-01-23 13:57:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Life’s a journey; from the Almighty &amp; back to Him eventually. As a traveler you must chart your course based on what He has prescribed for you. You will fail, you will fall &amp; you’ll get up again. Don’t be afraid to make U-turns. Seek His help often. He is the best GPS you have!"
1994,2020-01-23 06:11:18+00:00,muftimenk,Whatever you give attention to grows in importance. Don’t dwell on critics and haters. Focus on your Creator and His plans for you &amp; your life. Don’t worry about those trying to put you down. Your job is to respect others and not to hurt anyone. Do your best. He’ll do the rest!
1995,2020-01-22 18:22:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t brag about your achievements. Don’t make a song and dance about it. Whatever the Almighty has bestowed on you, protect it. Guard your blessings because people tend to ruin it. Yes, even the best of friends and the ones with pure hearts can ruin whatever you have."
1996,2020-01-22 03:54:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Tired &amp; weary as you are in your journey, you’re not alone. Your heart feels so much pain. You’re not alone. You need to be patient with what the Almighty has planned for you. For how long ? All your sacrifices will be worth it. The more patient you are, the greater your reward!"
1997,2020-01-21 19:49:51+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s inevitable to look at others &amp; yearn for their lifestyle on social media. Next time you find yourself doing that, stop &amp; think if it’s fair to compare your life with theirs when you’re only seeing a portion of their life they want you to see. You don’t have the full story!"
1998,2020-01-21 10:58:26+00:00,muftimenk,Stay positive. It’s the catalyst for survival in life. Your ability to be able to see the glass half full rather than half empty is the key to being happy and appreciating where you are in life. Gratitude is key. The Almighty will bestow you with more when you’re grateful!
1999,2020-01-20 22:10:28+00:00,muftimenk,Losing someone you love is a huge test of faith. That’s the reality of this life. How you pick yourself up and carry on shows how much you understand the Almighty’s plan. May He help us cope with our loss and reunite us with our loved ones in Paradise.
2000,2020-01-20 11:37:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose what you want in life. Happiness or sadness. It seems quite obvious but many don’t follow it up with action. If you want to be happy, work for it. Be proactive. Get the Almighty’s help not just for worldly things. Bit by bit your life will change. You’ll be content!"
2001,2020-01-20 04:55:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you’ve been having one disappointment after another, doesn’t mean things won’t get better. Trust the Almighty. The beauty of letting Him take over is that He knows us better than we know ourselves. Believe that whatever it is will arrive in His perfect timing!"
2002,2020-01-19 22:02:23+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think that everything is going wrong. The truth is something is still going right. You lose one thing, you gain another! When you can’t think of anything you’ve gained, there are still countless blessings to be thankful for. So when broken hearted, draw closer to Him!"
2003,2020-01-19 10:08:28+00:00,muftimenk,"It takes a huge amount of courage &amp; strength to forget about what you’re going through, the troubles in life &amp; put on a smile for the world to see. Appreciate how strong such people are for being able to stay positive in spite of everything! So always be kind to those you meet!"
2004,2020-01-18 20:10:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Cherish the scars you get in life. They serve as a constant reminder that you struggled &amp; strove to be who you are today. Not everyone can handle life crisis. Among the most beautiful people are those who've known defeat, suffering, struggle, loss &amp; they emerged winners!"
2005,2020-01-18 10:33:09+00:00,muftimenk,"How you feel about yourself should not be dictated by someone else’s opinion, points of view, words or thoughts. People will say what they want and they’ll judge. That’s human nature. Let it be. Don’t give them so much power over you. Stand your ground and just be yourself!"
2006,2020-01-17 23:15:51+00:00,muftimenk,"When you think your life’s falling apart; you’re going through a divorce, just lost your job, financial difficulties abound, your health’s suffering. It’s times like these where you need to draw even closer to the Almighty. Trust Him amid the pain. He will shine His light on you!"
2007,2020-01-17 13:34:42+00:00,muftimenk,People &amp; circumstances around you may try to push you down. But don’t worry; the Almighty is All-Knowing. He knows what to do. He knows who has evil intent; who’s trying to help you up &amp; will give you a hand! He puts people in your life for different purposes. Trust Him!
2008,2020-01-17 06:45:01+00:00,muftimenk,Doubt and disbelief - Satan’s handiwork! Don’t fall prey to any of that. Keep a lid on his whispering that will always come back to you. That is his forte. He will never give up. That’s why you need to bolt the door and focus on your journey ahead. Don’t let him trick you.
2009,2020-01-16 23:25:48+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant us peace of mind to ease our troubled hearts. The soul feels like a turbulent sea. It’s hard to navigate the troubled waters; we often stumble and worry constantly. Give us the strength and courage to steady ourselves and to stay afloat on the straight path.
2010,2020-01-16 15:36:12+00:00,muftimenk,You want to change things? Shift your mindset. Most things will never change until your mind does! Embrace positivity. Don’t let Satan or anyone mess with your mind. Keep your focus on your goal &amp; work at it. The Almighty never said it’d be easy but He promised it’d be worth it!
2011,2020-01-16 08:11:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t always blame  circumstances for where you are in life. The Almighty has blessed everyone of us with so much, it’s up to us to use those blessings in the best way. People who make it in life are those who take charge &amp; create circumstances instead of wandering aimlessly."
2012,2020-01-15 22:46:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop making negative comments &amp; spreading rumours about others. Not only are you ruining people’s reputation, you’re also giving yourself a bad name. Engage in positive activities and steer your mind towards all things good. You’ll end up attracting like-minded people! Try it!"
2013,2020-01-15 11:20:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Many people worry about not having figured out their lives. What does that really mean? As long as you’re on the path prescribed  by the Almighty and doing your best, trust Him to work it all out for you. You don’t have to figure everything out on your own. We have a loving Lord!"
2014,2020-01-15 01:57:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Some are so obsessed over winning an argument that they will do what it takes to get the upper hand. Don’t! Instead, take a step back and understand that no one ever wins in an argument. You often end up with a lot of bad feelings. Do your best to stay away from such situations!"
2015,2020-01-14 20:27:34+00:00,muftimenk,Take ownership of your life. Don’t expect people to fix things for you when they go wrong as they often will. It’s not someone's responsibility to fill in the missing pieces of our lives. Learn to be self-sufficient.  Resolve your issues soonest possible. Don’t let them fester!
2016,2020-01-14 04:24:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Make a concerted effort to remove guilt, anger, blame, resentment, regret, worry, envy and hate from your heart. Your life and health will improve dramatically once you eliminate these diseases. Peace and contentment will reign in your new mindset. Do it today!"
2017,2020-01-13 16:02:49+00:00,muftimenk,"In times of hardship, pain and loss who do you turn to first? Make sure you seek solutions and a way out from the Almighty instead of others. Let us not search for temporary comforts in people and worldly things. May we be among those who seek help through patience and prayer!"
2018,2020-01-13 08:55:00+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty is watching to see what you do with the wealth He has blessed you with. There are those who try to impress others with the money they have. They’re quick to spend money when it helps them look good, but don’t do anything to help people who desperately need it!"
2019,2020-01-12 20:17:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be an arrogant sinner. Quickly acknowledge your sin, repent and get back on track. The Almighty, with His limitless Mercy will forgive you. Remember, Paradise and Hellfire exist for sinners. The former for the repentant ones &amp; the latter for those who are arrogant."
2020,2020-01-12 12:31:07+00:00,muftimenk,"So your life’s a mess &amp; you can’t find a way out. You’ve never felt so alone. Remember, in the blink of an eye, the Almighty can show you a way out. You only have to turn to Him. Ask Him. He’s capable of giving you what you want and more. He will heal you. He will protect you."
2021,2020-01-12 11:22:17+00:00,muftimenk,"It's time to thank you all for your support and give you an update. @Abdullahaiduk

2022,2020-01-12 00:43:31+00:00,muftimenk,"My heartfelt condolences to the people of Oman on the passing of their beloved #SultanQaboos bin Saeed. May the Almighty grant him the highest Paradise.

My congratulations &amp; prayer also go out to the newly appointed #SultanHaitham bin Tariq. May #Oman continue to prosper."
2023,2020-01-11 23:15:29+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty knows you better than you know yourself. He knows everything about you to the minutest detail. Every dream in your heart, He is aware of. Whatever He gives you is for your own good. Whatever He withholds from your is also for your own good. So do not be sad!"
2024,2020-01-11 16:58:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing in your life is a mistake. Everything has been carefully planned by the Almighty to the minutest detail. Your job is to always do your best. Even when you think nothing is going on, He’s busy behind the scenes. He will open doors which you could never open by yourself!"
2025,2020-01-11 07:56:02+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re trusted, take it seriously. Trust is fragile. Because it’s often given freely, it’s also easily taken for granted. Once you’ve been betrayed, it can be very hard, if not impossible, to earn it back. The scars may be so deep &amp; are forever embedded in a person’s mind!"
2026,2020-01-10 21:53:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Some get a big thrill from boasting about their achievements or showing off their possessions. They believe that they’re better than others. They may even end up bossing people around. That’s wrong. Remember, whatever you have, someone will have more! That’s life! Stay humble!"
2027,2020-01-10 16:51:58+00:00,muftimenk,"We don’t respond well to being put down &amp; pride gives people that feeling with its “I’m better than you” implications. Humility has the opposite effect. If you put others above yourself, they’ll feel good whenever they’re around you. That will surely have a positive impact!"
2028,2020-01-10 06:42:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Take the spite out of your heart. Purify it. Your heart is a small organ. When you fill it with hatred for someone, you’re preventing it from being filled with the love of the Almighty. Always ask Him to protect us from hearts that are consumed by hatred, envy, pride, jealousy!"
2029,2020-01-10 01:43:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty, in a world that never stops talking, let us learn to appreciate silence. Grant us the ability to listen to the unspoken words many are uttering but no one is listening because everyone’s busy talking. Grant ease to those who are battling their trials quietly! Aameen!"
2030,2020-01-09 10:12:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Make it a point to encourage someone today. Urge them to hang in there, to persist towards their goal. Keep reminding them, show your concern and interest in their well-being, say a prayer for them. People are empowered by the words, “I’m so proud of what you are doing.”"
2031,2020-01-08 16:56:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people spend their whole life waiting. Waiting for the right time to repent from sins, to worship the Almighty, to turn over a new leaf, to do good etc. This is the trap of Satan. No one is promised tomorrow. Don’t waste your life procrastinating. Do your best today!"
2032,2020-01-08 05:46:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyone makes mistakes. There are no exceptions. The person we’re dealing with may be new to what they are doing, not feeling well, or coping with personal issues &amp; are doing their best to carry on. Giving them the chance to make it right could be the small respite they need!"
2033,2020-01-07 21:16:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you guilty of harsh speech, not showing mercy to others, ugly character, poor conduct, judgemental and always complaining? If you have any of these traits, it’s time to clean up your act. Work consciously to eradicate such behaviour and feel the goodness you will attract!"
2034,2020-01-07 14:38:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Every day we hear people lament that they don’t have enough time. Actually, the real problem is we waste so much of it that we lose track of time! Take stock of how you spend your time. Don’t make excuses. Start doing what matters most. You’ll be amazed at what you can achieve!"
2035,2020-01-07 07:33:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Be aware of what you’re spreading. Today, people thrive on fake news, half truths &amp; gossip. Society tends to applaud such things &amp; punish people for being genuine and authentic. Don’t be part of this culture. Verify your sources;  read &amp; re-read before you hit that button!"
2036,2020-01-06 21:11:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop playing the blame game. Some just blame others for all their problems. They’re never responsible, accountable or want to take ownership of their problems. It’s always someone else’s fault. This is a dangerous way to live. Change your mindset if you want to fix your life."
2037,2020-01-06 07:56:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Today we’re more argumentative than we’ve ever been &amp; one of the main reasons for this is social media. We’ve seen in posts where tempers flare, harsh words are used. A virtual shouting match with people we’ve never even met! Don’t get involved. Stay away from arguments!"
2038,2020-01-05 21:33:38+00:00,muftimenk,"We used to say don't believe till you see it with your own eyes. Today, it’s no longer true. Even if you see it with your own eyes &amp; it looks or sounds so REAL, there’s huge possibility it's a #deepfake video; that’s photoshopped, edited or totally fabricated. Be very cautious!"
2039,2020-01-05 13:29:32+00:00,muftimenk,"There are people around you who need what you have. Use whatever the Almighty has bestowed you with to help others as much as you can. It need not be material. Time, energy, words of motivation, a listening ear, a helping hand can go a long way towards brightening someone’s day!"
2040,2020-01-05 05:39:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Shake off what didn’t work and don’t live in yesterday’s mindset. Work hard to achieve what you want. Nothing comes easy. The Almighty has given you much, so make use of the faculties you have and don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty. Hard work never killed anyone!"
2041,2020-01-04 17:46:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Pleasure and pain. Happiness &amp; sadness. Sunshine and rain. Good days &amp; bad days. This is life. The journey that we’re all on right now. Remember, if you trust the Almighty, there are no sad endings. You’ll reach your destination beautifully. He will see to that!"
2042,2020-01-04 08:11:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t underestimate the little things you do for others. No matter how small the act, it will come back to you eventually. The appreciation and thank you may be delayed for ages but that’s ok because your reward is truly with the Almighty. So do things out of love not obligation!"
2043,2020-01-04 01:28:21+00:00,muftimenk,Cultivate a good heart. It takes discipline. It’s hard work. It won’t happen overnight. This is your secret to success in this world &amp; the next. Always have  good intentions &amp; learn to be happy for others. Good will come your way and the Almighty will open more doors for you.
2044,2020-01-03 13:49:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Forgive us for all the times when we were facing problems &amp; were so quick to become discouraged or depressed; thinking there was no way out.  We forget how You’ve never let us down. No matter what comes our way, we’ll put our trust in You. We know You’ll see us through!"
2045,2020-01-03 04:34:36+00:00,muftimenk,Your past is a mirror to your present. Learn from it and aim to not make the same mistakes again. A new chapter awaits you each day when you wake. Aim to be a better person today than you were yesterday. Don’t overlook even small acts of goodness. They do make a difference!
2046,2020-01-02 11:47:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Thank the Almighty that He does not judge us by what we achieve. He looks at the effort we put in always. All He wants is that we do it sincerely, with heart &amp; soul to please Him. If our intention is wrong, no matter how much success we achieve, it means nothing to Him!"
2047,2020-01-01 23:37:57+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to think the worst of something. In fact, it comes naturally to many. To think the best requires faith. Especially when things look bleak. That’s the Almighty testing you to see how you’ll respond. Do you crumble and throw in the towel or do you press on and trust Him?"
2048,2020-01-01 09:27:01+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in an instant society. What you want, you get almost immediately. Instant gratification is key. We are wired that way. But real life’s not like that. Our tests require patience. Success doesn’t happen overnight. Appreciate the journey. The beauty is in the struggle."
2049,2020-01-01 00:05:18+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want positive change, get out of your comfort zone and start today. Just talking about it isn’t going to make a difference. Change can be daunting; in fact, anything to do with the unknown has that effect. Give it your best shot. Trust the Almighty in your journey!"
2050,2019-12-31 14:22:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose goals that are realistic which can be done on a regular basis. Remember, the Almighty loves acts that are consistent. So start small; work on it instead of trying to do it all at once &amp; then quickly losing steam."
2051,2019-12-30 22:31:11+00:00,muftimenk,"People are such that if good touches you, it distresses them; but if harm strikes you, they rejoice at it. Such is life in this day &amp; age. That’s why you need to be discerning when sharing aspects of your life! Choose carefully. Not everyone deserves to know everything about you!"
2052,2019-12-30 11:19:21+00:00,muftimenk,"""Everyone's doing it. You're young, have some fun"" - the familiar whisperings of Satan. Protect yourself from his tricks. Don’t go down that road. Don’t give in. Stay firm. Keep a level head and exercise self-restraint. Seek your strength from the Almighty."
2053,2019-12-30 00:00:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Never mind the haters &amp; their negativity. Focus on doing good &amp; spreading positivity. Haters are insecure &amp; feel insignificant. When they see others improving their life, it’s a direct reflection of what they should be doing but are not. Don’t hate them back. Pray for them."
2054,2019-12-29 10:59:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Your tongue can be your greatest asset or biggest liability. The choice is yours. It has only 8 muscles but it can make or break you, creating problems with your words. Constantly ask the Almighty to help you control it &amp; guide its usage. Make it work for you not against you!"
2055,2019-12-29 01:55:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be ashamed of the scars you get in life. They are proof of your inner strength. It shows you've lived your life fully; how you picked yourself up when you fell, how you refused to give up, handled defeat &amp; storms. How you rose above it all. That's what matters in the end!"
2056,2019-12-28 10:32:28+00:00,muftimenk,"When your heart is heavy &amp; burdened &amp; your mind sees no way out, that’s when you need to trust the Almighty &amp; depend on Him even more. Don’t entertain negative thoughts from Satan. Rise above it. It won’t be easy but you must do it. Bear utmost patience &amp; He will find a way out!"
2057,2019-12-28 04:20:12+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to focus on the negatives in your life and start complaining about what’s not good enough or what’s lacking. Don’t do it. Because it will steal your peace and you’ll never be satisfied with what you have, always wanting more. Don’t let your hearts be troubled."
2058,2019-12-27 19:54:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Walking around with a heart that’s hardened is one of the worst calamities that can befall anyone. Don’t allow it to reach that stage. Constantly remember the Almighty. Should you feel yourself getting distant from Him, quickly rectify the situation by getting back on track."
2059,2019-12-27 10:02:06+00:00,muftimenk,"What’s past is done and gone forever. You can’t go back in time to undo anything. Accept what happened and seek forgiveness from the Almighty. The only thing to do is to go forward, learn from past mistakes and with hindsight, forgive yourself for not knowing better then."
2060,2019-12-27 03:51:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Keep our hearts connected to You at all times. When we’re tempted to sin, let us remember that You’re watching &amp; that the Angels are recording what we do. Give us the strength to exercise self-restraint. Make it difficult for us to commit acts that incur Your Wrath!"
2061,2019-12-26 15:22:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to restrain your anger because if you let it get out of hand, the consequences will be dire. Cursing, swearing, spewing hate &amp; hurting someone are possible outcomes. Anger can lead to many evils. So exercise self-control &amp; you won’t have to live with regret."
2062,2019-12-26 10:19:18+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t argue for the sake of arguing. Some just need to find flaws in everything or disagree just to be disagreeable. The Almighty dislikes such acts. You don’t always need to have the last say &amp; be the smartest person in the room. Choose your battles &amp; have a sense of proportion.
2063,2019-12-25 18:44:17+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s wisdom in embracing your mistakes. What would we learn if we never made mistakes? Let us not be embarrassed by them &amp; view them positively. Accept that we are not &amp; never will be perfect! We are a never ending work in progress! If you’re not working on it, start today!"
2064,2019-12-25 09:14:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Whether you’re celebrating #Christmas or not, whether you're on holiday or not, be respectful &amp; learn to coexist peacefully. Learn to accept difference of opinion. Imposing your opinion on others won't heal the ailing globe. Hate less &amp; love more. Think hard about this."
2065,2019-12-25 08:29:15+00:00,muftimenk,"The world today is such that whatever people don’t know about you, they create. They piece together what they hear from rumours, social media as well as assumptions &amp; lies. It spreads really fast by the touch of a button. Stay away from such acts. You’ll be held accountable!"
2066,2019-12-25 00:37:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Some can’t stop living in the past. They keep replaying the same scenario over &amp; over again, how much they suffered, how they were mistreated etc. Such things only poison your mind, make it hard for you to move on &amp; fill you with negativity. Break free from the past! Move on!"
2067,2019-12-24 13:22:42+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty doesn't just tell us to do something; He guides us through it. Part of it includes getting us to be in the right place at the right time. He puts different people in our lives at different times. Nothing is a coincidence. You just have to surrender and trust Him!
2068,2019-12-24 07:15:11+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let Satan fool you into thinking that you have a lot of time left in this world. You don’t. Nobody does. Focus on your life ahead and free yourself from Satan’s traps. It can be challenging but keep going. Continue to strive for His Pleasure in all that you do!
2069,2019-12-23 14:45:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Even if all doors seem closed &amp; you feel like you’re facing a dead end, the Almighty can &amp; will provide alternative solutions to your problem. Understand His Plan. Keep a look out for new opportunities. Often we are so hung up on the closed doors that we fail to see what’s there!"
2070,2019-12-23 05:38:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to appreciate closed doors. They’re not meant to hurt you. But they’re there to save you. It’s difficult for us to understand this at times, given our limited minds. We need to fully trust the Almighty, who is in complete control. He is flawless. He knows what He’s doing."
2071,2019-12-22 16:44:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Arrogance at its worst would have you believe that you're always right. You strut around like you know everything. Confidence is humble, quiet &amp; doesn't shout. You’re full of beneficial knowledge &amp; you share it in a manner that doesn’t make the other person feel ignorant!"
2072,2019-12-22 06:47:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing good comes from sowing or spewing venom on others. You might “feel” good for a while but trust me, it will cause more problems in the long run. It will come back to haunt you in ways you never imagined. The Almighty will see to it. Best to stay away from such toxic acts."
2073,2019-12-21 15:37:22+00:00,muftimenk,You have the choice to focus on your blessings or your problems. Whichever you choose will either bring about contentment or worry &amp; stress in your life. The more you focus on your blessings the more the Almighty will bestow upon you. He loves a grateful heart. So choose wisely!
2074,2019-12-21 09:55:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Worry is one of the biggest thieves around. It can steal your time, rob you of your sleep, affect your peace of mind, sap your energy and leave you completely stressed out. Turn your worry into worship. Seek the Almighty and find your much-needed strength to carry on."
2075,2019-12-21 04:08:00+00:00,muftimenk,Be careful the friends you choose for you will become like them. The opinions of your friends are often more important than those of others; even your family members. That’s why it’s in your interest to choose your friends wisely. They can be the reason why you succeed or fail!
2076,2019-12-20 18:33:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Negative emotions will bring about negative consequences. Just as we learn how helpful love &amp; compassion can be, we also understand that anger, pride, jealousy and arrogance can be detrimental. So always choose to respond positively. It will have a huge impact on your life."
2077,2019-12-20 05:29:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant peace in our hearts. There’s so much confusion around us &amp; we lack clarity of mind. We’re worried &amp; anxious, always thinking about our problems. Calm us down. Remove everything that’s causing grieve, sorrow &amp; stress in our lives. Heal &amp; guide us in our journey!"
2078,2019-12-19 21:46:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be afraid of change for the better. Be afraid of staying the same! When we’re no longer able to change a situation, we’re challenged to change ourselves. It takes courage, discipline &amp; focus. Seek your strength from the Almighty. Do it single-mindedly. You’ll get there!"
2079,2019-12-19 08:08:12+00:00,muftimenk,"You don’t have to compromise your convictions to be compassionate. By all means disagree with someone on anything and everything. But don’t hate them. Similarly, just because you love someone, you don’t have to agree with everything they believe or do. Be firm but polite always!"
2080,2019-12-18 21:57:21+00:00,muftimenk,"You don’t need people’s approval to be content in life or to do good. If they have issues with you, it’s not about you, it’s about their insecurities. You don’t need to prove anything to anyone. Let it go or you’ll end up exasperated. Your approval is from the Almighty."
2081,2019-12-18 12:10:09+00:00,muftimenk,The only ones who matter are truly those who cheer loudest for you when you’re down. They believe in you when others don’t. They stand by you when others have abandoned you. Such people are few and far between these days. You’re blessed if you have such a person in your life!
2082,2019-12-18 09:14:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Family is very important. To hold it together, be easy going. Be kind and very polite. Stay away from hurtful &amp; abusive language. Don't ever jump to negative conclusions.

So why do we live life as if it’s forever and we take death so lightly. We forget that it can overtake us anytime, anywhere. Life is short. Remember no one is promised tomorrow."
2084,2019-12-17 19:10:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about being popular and loved by the masses. If you choose to get closer to the Almighty and live a life according to His Plan, you’ll find yourself walking alone mostly. It may seem daunting and frightening at times. But don’t worry. He’s your Guide &amp; Protector!"
2085,2019-12-17 04:22:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Unfortunately, many people today think that unwholesome talk &amp; swear words are cool. They’re not. Obscene, foolish talk or tasteless jokes do nothing for those who listen. If at all, they might be hurtful. Keep a tight reign on your tongue &amp; always use words that build others up!"
2086,2019-12-16 21:08:02+00:00,muftimenk,Happiness will not come to those who are never grateful for the Almighty’s blessings; those who don’t appreciate what they already have. This world is not a place where you get exactly what you want. There are many out there who will never have what you have; so be thankful!
2087,2019-12-16 03:27:29+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re always unhappy &amp; discontented with life, check yourself for these symptoms. Are you always criticising others; complaining that your life isn’t good enough; quick to condemn people or comparing yourself with your neighbours? Stop doing all that &amp; feel the difference!"
2088,2019-12-15 15:58:31+00:00,muftimenk,"We tend to beat ourselves up over our own mistakes. But we forget that what we see as a mistake, the Almighty uses it to propel us forward to live a life of purpose. So be kind to yourself. Learn from the mistakes. They enable you to grow as a person &amp; become a better you!"
2089,2019-12-15 04:48:14+00:00,muftimenk,"The sadness you see, the disappointment you witness, the Almighty knows it all. We all fight battles no one knows except Him. Just remember, He knows all &amp;  can help with all. There is no pain He does not understand. There is no struggle He does not know. He is All-Knowing!"
2090,2019-12-14 23:18:25+00:00,muftimenk,"If Satan can’t trap someone into sinning, be it major or minor, he keeps them busy with trivial acts which have no benefit. Instead of using our time wisely, fulfilling our priorities towards the Almighty &amp; reaching our goal, Satan occupies us with useless actions. Stay vigilant!"
2091,2019-12-14 13:47:14+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of social media, may we always be protected from unintentional evil we set on ourselves. Keep thanking the Almighty for all that He has blessed us with and be careful when showing off your blessings for the world to see. Keep arrogance at bay and always stay humble!"
2092,2019-12-14 05:04:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop trying to seek answers for everything. Some questions don’t need answers &amp; they’re better off that way. You just need a firm heart, full of trust that it will turn out fine. A heart full of love &amp; peace. You’ll be amazed at how much more you get out of the unspoken at times."
2093,2019-12-13 23:26:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Oftentimes it’s hard for people to own up to their mistakes because they do not want to be seen negatively. In reality, it takes a strong person with integrity to admit a mistake. Those who are quick to realize, admit &amp; apologize are more likely to gain the respect of others."
2094,2019-12-13 12:29:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. In this troubled world, grant us peace and serenity to soothe our hearts and spirits right now. When we find ourselves awake in the middle of the night, our trials and tribulations can feel overwhelming. Keep us calm and content knowing You’re always watching over us!"
2095,2019-12-12 22:12:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the ‘friends’ who find joy in your misery. Unfortunately there are many such people around. Remember, wishing ill for others will never resolve your problems or make them go away. Instead, pray for ease all round and the Almighty will alleviate your suffering!"
2096,2019-12-12 12:58:44+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has gifted you with unique abilities and talents. They’re special to you. Remember, He blesses us all differently. Never allow anyone to make you feel insignificant. Such people love to make another person feel as though they aren't important. Don’t stand for it!"
2097,2019-12-12 05:16:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Disappointment, pain &amp; suffering are part of life. They’re gut-wrenching &amp; can affect us negatively. Remember, the Almighty wants us to learn a lesson in all that happens. So we have to find the best possible way to cope with such situations. Knowing that nothing lasts, helps!"
2098,2019-12-11 21:20:17+00:00,muftimenk,"In this life, you won’t always get what you want. But remember, by being grateful for what you have, you’re inviting more goodness into your life. Think of all those people who would trade places with you at the drop of a hat! Appreciate what He has bestowed on you always."
2099,2019-12-11 05:13:24+00:00,muftimenk,"People will disappoint you. There’ll be times when they won’t meet your expectations. This can happen quite often. Instead of feeling let down, understand the Almighty’s plan in all this. He’s showing you that you can’t depend on others. Lay your full trust and hopes in Him!"
2100,2019-12-10 15:39:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes it’s best to let things be. You don’t need the answers to everything, you don’t have to be right always, don’t expect people to understand you and don’t fight to get your points across. Just be polite but firm. Work on yourself and keep your inner peace at all times!"
2101,2019-12-10 06:25:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do comes back to you; good or bad; sooner or later. You’re a reflection of what you put out to the world. If you often use &amp; abuse people, life will use &amp; abuse you. If you dedicate your life to doing good, you will be rewarded. Be positive, kind &amp; compassionate."
2102,2019-12-09 14:12:22+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty puts different people in our lives at different times. It’s not an accident. It’s not a coincident. There’s a reason behind everything. People will come and go. Don't be disappointed or disheartened. Learn and grow from every experience. Keep moving forward.
2103,2019-12-08 23:38:46+00:00,muftimenk,"He knows your pain, struggles, fears &amp; anxieties. He knows they’re keeping you awake at night. He knows you’re trying your best to cope. He tests those whom He loves. And that He won’t burden you more than you can bear. Keep going just a little more. Trust that His help is near!"
2104,2019-12-08 14:06:04+00:00,muftimenk,The truth is we’re being pulled in a huge way to conform to the ways of the world. Everyday we’re being bombarded with this mesage. We need to stand strong and firm. Rise above that which is prohibited by the Almighty. Rise above the darkness! Don’t give in. The choice is yours.
2105,2019-12-07 20:40:20+00:00,muftimenk,"You have to admit that the closest you’ve been to the Almighty was during your darkest days. When you felt you had no other option, when you were facing life trials. Get into the habit of making Him a part of your life. In good &amp; bad times. You’ll have a different view of life!"
2106,2019-12-07 13:42:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Trusting the Almighty when things are smooth &amp; going well is easy. But when things are bleak &amp; uncertain, what will you do? Do you crumble &amp; cave in? That’s one of the greatest tests. He’s watching to see how you react. Have firm faith. Have your heart in the right place!"
2107,2019-12-07 05:00:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feel like you have to be drawn into every debate, every argument about any controversial issue. There are those who love to dissect every word &amp; take issue with the smallest things. Don’t get involved with them. Don’t pass judgment. Don’t quarrel over disputable matters!"

For every fear that grips your heart,
For every worry that keeps you awake,
For every loss that you grieve over,
For anything &amp; everything that you can’t handle, leave it to the Lord of the Worlds. He’s the best disposer of affairs for us!"
2109,2019-12-06 09:17:13+00:00,muftimenk,Do you think you’re perfect &amp; superior? Do you think everyone else needs to change but not you? Do you often shift focus from fixing yourself to fixing others? Be conscious of such mind traps. It’s Satan at work. He will make you feel proud &amp; self-reliant! Check yourself!
2110,2019-12-06 01:27:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us Your Mercy, relieve our fears and anxieties, remove our distress and let peace reign in our hearts. Bestow upon us patience and wisdom in all our endeavours and trials of life. May You always be our guiding light and the beacon of hope in our lives. Aameen."
2111,2019-12-05 14:43:07+00:00,muftimenk,Choose healing over hurting. Keep trying instead of giving up. Be kind instead of being mean &amp; harsh. Learn to forgive instead of harbouring grudges. Do this consciously &amp; you’ll find your heart lighter &amp; more at ease. Build one another up rather than tear one another down!
2112,2019-12-05 05:25:14+00:00,muftimenk,"There’ll be occasions when you feel like time’s running out and you are still waiting for the Almighty to work His Plan. That’s normal. You may feel discouraged. Some may go to extremes and start to question everything. Remember, it’s darkest before dawn. Hold tight to the rope!"
2113,2019-12-04 18:59:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Take control of your life. Don’t be like the candle in the wind, always vulnerable. Don’t let your life spin out of control. If you feel like you’re heading in the wrong direction, quickly turn back. Don’t let Satan take the wheel. Seek your strength from the Almighty."
2114,2019-12-04 11:29:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remember that everyone is going through something; dealing with issues the best way they can and know how. No one is perfect.

The Almighty has a plan for everything that we experience. Nothing is ever wasted. Sooner or later, we’ll see the light of day and thank Him."

And we do it with such certainty as if tomorrow is promised to everyone. There’s no harm in planning but always remember that the Almighty can change things in the blink of an eye.
2117,2019-12-03 10:56:57+00:00,muftimenk,The best thing you can do for yourself is to treat people better than how they treated you. Be kind to the unkind. Be the first to forgive. Lift the person who tried to push you down. Utter good words to your haters. Smile for no apparent reason just because you are grateful!
2118,2019-12-03 04:12:03+00:00,muftimenk,"When people try to belittle you, scoff at your ideas or criticise you, don’t despair. What they’re showing you is their story; not yours.

2119,2019-12-02 21:21:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be afraid of failure. It shows you’re human. This life is anything but perfect. So failure teaches you there’s room to grow and become better. With every shortcoming, we can learn something. Remember, your mistakes don’t define you. The truth is they teach you!"
2120,2019-12-02 07:25:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t wait to turn back to the Almighty. Do it today. It’s as good a day as any; the sooner, the better. Seek Him.

It will all take its toll on your health!"

Remember, one day, all the pieces of the puzzle will fit and you’ll be so pleased that you were patient right till the end!"
2149,2019-11-21 04:07:10+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t worry about those who talk bad about you behind your back. The Almighty is All-Knowing and All-Seeing. He heard them. He will protect you and grant you blessings. You can’t stop people from talking but you can control how you respond to them. Stay above the fray.
2150,2019-11-20 22:24:31+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re doing well &amp; making good progress, others will try to plant seeds of doubt &amp; negativity all round. Bear patience. Don’t worry. The Almighty’s in full control. No one can touch you when He’s with you. Keep your focus on the task ahead. Don’t be distracted."
2151,2019-11-20 11:58:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Always be kind. Motivate, empower, encourage and spread goodness. Do your best always. If your actions are not reciprocated, that’s okay. Keep going. It will all bear  fruit one day. And if you find yourself not able to do any of that, the least you can do is to not hurt others!"
2152,2019-11-20 06:43:08+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’ve left the Almighty out of your equation for some time because of your repeated sins, it’s time to seek Him out again today. Don’t waste any more time. Get back on track. He’s waiting to forgive you. He will heal you &amp; make you whole again. Just one sincere repentance!"
2153,2019-11-19 17:54:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be complacent about the good deeds you do. There’s no such thing as auto-acceptance from the Almighty. In this age of social media where everything is up for the world to see, it gets even more difficult. Are you doing it for Him or for the likes and accolades from people?"
2154,2019-11-19 10:36:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Some love to gossip because they say the truth has become very boring. It doesn't sell, earn likes or followers. They'd rather harm others by spreading juicy false tales than speak the boring, unwanted, unpopular truth. Be wary of such people. More importantly, don't become one!"
2155,2019-11-19 03:20:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you want a good day? Well, start with the Almighty and end with the Almighty. Everything in between gets that much easier. Remember to do your best always, purify your intentions and whenever you find something is too much to handle, hand it over to the Lord of the Worlds."
2156,2019-11-18 20:01:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t dwell on how privileged you are &amp; how good your life is. It’s how you end the journey that matters. Strive to live a life that endears you to your Creator. Everything else is secondary. Keep asking for a good end. Remember nothing is guaranteed in life, not even tomorrow!"
2157,2019-11-18 07:28:43+00:00,muftimenk,"As humans, we will get frustrated from time to time. When that happens, when our emotions begin to drive us, take a step back from the situation &amp; let the Almighty take over. Pray that He grants us wisdom each time. Don’t feel like you have to do it alone. He’s only a call away!"
2158,2019-11-17 23:06:47+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t underestimate the power of prayer. Don’t ask the Almighty for help only as the last resort. He fully expects us to make an effort to solve our problems but He doesn’t want us to do it alone. He’s always there for us but waits for us to reach out. Call out to Him!
2159,2019-11-17 14:42:11+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t ever believe that you’re the only one facing problem after problem. It’s all a matter of perception &amp; perspective. Other people have been there before or have had it worse. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. The path is there. Trust the Almighty in your journey!
2160,2019-11-17 03:26:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Do your best always but don’t expect perfect results. Remember, you’re human. You’re a work in progress. Take ownership of your mistakes. Learn from them. Forgive others when they make mistakes too. You’ll be a much happier person with a very different outlook towards life."
2161,2019-11-16 17:13:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't rejoice over the misfortune of others. Remember, the Almighty is the fairest of judges. Let Him repay or punish others for whatever they’ve done. He’s All-Seeing, All-Knowing. We shouldn't find joy in anybody’s sorrow. Surely we wouldn’t like it if we were in their shoes!"
2162,2019-11-16 14:39:19+00:00,muftimenk,What is more important to you?
2163,2019-11-16 05:15:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you feeling anxious? Wondering what’s ahead? Your mind’s racing &amp; your heart’s beating so fast. You keep asking where all this will lead to? One moment you’re panicking, the next, you’re calm. The Almighty wants you to trust that no matter what's ahead, He is always with you."
2164,2019-11-15 20:59:54+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s natural to feel broken if you’ve been treated badly or been the subject of rumours etc. But remember, some things are not within your control. Turn every anxiety, fear &amp; concern into a supplication. Look at it as another reason to submit to the Almighty. Let Him take over!"
2165,2019-11-15 09:37:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Gossip is wrong, no matter how you look at it. Spreading malicious rumors will not only hurt the person concerned but it can actually backfire on the person who originated the inconsiderate falsehood. No one ever benefits from mean and hurtful discussions about other people."
2166,2019-11-14 22:36:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us strength and endurance to go through the tough tests right now. Many are wandering hopelessly. We know giving up is not an option. Keep us steadfast and firm in faith. No matter what's happening, fill our hearts with hope always. We know You have our backs!"

2168,2019-11-14 17:43:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Some get threatened when other people shine their light on the rest of world. They think that if you shine bright, it somehow gives them less opportunity to find their own success. Remember, the Almighty has given us all a chance to be successful. There is room for ALL of us."
2169,2019-11-14 04:57:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop oversharing. Stop telling everything about your life to others. Our constant need for approval from virtual strangers is somewhat problematic. If we refrain from sharing a situation, it doesn't become any less valid or exciting. Rather, it becomes more personal &amp; valuable!"
2170,2019-11-13 22:02:23+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what others say about you, keep going. Just close your eyes and remind yourself that the Almighty is watching. Your efforts, your patience etc, He’s aware of everything. Look past the struggles, look past the pain. It’s not easy but it will all be worth it in the end."
2171,2019-11-13 12:02:33+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of social media, it’s easy to fret if your efforts don’t receive recognition or publicity. But realise that the Almighty’s protecting your sincerity &amp; your work from corruption. Rremember, He loves deeds that are small &amp; consistent.  So don’t  shortchange yourself."
2172,2019-11-12 21:01:31+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty wills something, nothing can stop it from happening. We should submit to Him &amp; not question it. So, don’t get disheartened if you’re not married or with children yet. You may not be where you want to be; but you’re exactly where He wants you to be."
2173,2019-11-12 16:54:05+00:00,muftimenk,Your value as a person does not come from the material things in life. You always have something of value to offer the world &amp; you don’t need anyone else’s validation to know this. So don’t compare yourself to your friends. Be happy for them whatever their situation may be!
2174,2019-11-12 09:39:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t expect perfection in this life. The mess ups, the delays, the heartbreaks, the things you don’t understand, they’re all part of the Almighty’s Plan for you. He’s worked out every detail in each chapter of your life. Your job is to bear good patience as you go through it!"
2175,2019-11-11 21:53:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Realize that you cannot control other people. You can’t force them to do what they don’t want to do. The only person you can control is you.  So don’t let their behaviour &amp; what they do upset you. Your worrying, obsessing, venting etc, has zero impact on them. It only hurts you."

2177,2019-11-11 10:17:53+00:00,muftimenk,Never let anybody steal your happiness. Never let anyone keep you from seeing &amp; sharing goodness with those around you. Never let someone’s hurtful words or actions wound you so deeply that you feel crippled &amp; unable to forgive them. Let it go.Keep your focus. Rise above it all!
2178,2019-11-11 00:49:32+00:00,muftimenk,What they did to you wasn’t about you. Understand that &amp; stop thinking that you did them wrong. It was about unresolved issues within themselves. It’s really not about you at all. It is about THEM &amp; what’s inside them coming out &amp; projecting onto you. So don’t take it personally!
2179,2019-11-10 19:26:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit relying on people. They’ll only let you down. Today, they’re your friend, tomorrow, they could be your enemy. Now, they approve of you, the next minute they don’t! It’s all about their whims and fancies. Rely on the Almighty. He’s all you need!"
2180,2019-11-10 05:10:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Regrets, mistakes, failures are all part of life. Do yourself a favour and don’t dwell on them. Learn the lessons they’re meant to teach you and move on. Life’s too short to be crying over what didn’t work out. The Almighty’s giving you another opportunity. Don’t waste it!"
2181,2019-11-09 16:38:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Difficulty is somewhat like darkness. When you can’t understand what’s going on, you’re lost, in pain &amp; you feel the whole world closing in on you. That’s the time when you have to lay complete trust in the Almighty. Have faith in Him. Bear good patience &amp; He will rescue you!"
2182,2019-11-09 09:08:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Disagree by all means but don’t become rude &amp; vulgar. Sadly, we only want to hear from those who are like-minded . We detest opinions &amp; views that differ from ours. We’re highly intolerant. If you want to grow as a person, start listening to others. Appreciate their viewpoint!"
2183,2019-11-09 01:26:06+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, you often have to make a choice that’s not easy. Always seek your strength &amp; guidance from the Almighty. Don’t wallow in self-pity. Don’t stand in the midst of fear without trusting Him.  Remember, He knows best. It’ll make it easier to move on, knowing He has your back!"
2184,2019-11-08 15:31:40+00:00,muftimenk,You may think they’re taking your words lightly because they’re always smiling. Be careful what you say because such people are close to the Almighty; they cry &amp; pour their heart out at night to the Lord of the Worlds. They carry a sense of tranquility &amp; softness in their hearts!
2185,2019-11-08 09:55:44+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Heal our broken hearts that have been wounded by others. Guide us in the journey towards healing &amp; recovery. Grant us patience &amp; wisdom; encourage us to take the correct steps to find peace in our distress. Only You Have the power to change despair into hope! Aameen!
2186,2019-11-07 18:05:41+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s rather sad if you feel unappreciated for what you’ve done. But the truth is, purify your intent and do things solely for the Almighty. That way, no matter how others respond to the good work you’ve done, your heart is still attached to the only One who matters. He sees you!"
2187,2019-11-07 09:58:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Often in life we get upset with what happens, especially when things don’t go according to our plan. We forget who is in control. The Lord of the Worlds has the best plans for us always, yet we often doubt, get upset and start questioning Him! Remember, He is the Best Planner."
2188,2019-11-06 23:53:58+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re often disappointed by others, you have to learn to manage your expectations. Why do we expect so much from others while expecting so little of ourselves. Have confidence in yourself and your abilities. The Almighty has blessed you with a lot. Use the blessings wisely."
2189,2019-11-06 15:50:01+00:00,muftimenk,Everything that happens in your life happens for a reason. It’s part of your story.  It was written for you. What’s this life but a series of tests. Take it as a lesson &amp; move on. Sometimes you'll be knocked down but you must quickly get up. Brace yourself for the journey ahead.
2190,2019-11-06 09:17:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Stamp out that ego and pride. Don’t allow them to get in the way of your personal growth &amp; development. Oftentimes, we blame others for everything &amp; keep defending ourselves even when we’re wrong. Quit this habit. Take ownership of your mistakes. It shows strength of character."
2191,2019-11-05 23:13:55+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re no stranger to pain. It’ll change you. But how it affects you is up to you. Some get really upset, bitter with life. Some take it in their stride; try their best to cope. Some smile &amp; breeze through it! Let your pain have a good purpose. Let it make you better &amp; stronger!"
2192,2019-11-05 11:01:03+00:00,muftimenk,"With humans, you seldom get second chances. Once you’ve messed up, you’re labelled a failure. With the Almighty, it’s completely different. You’ll be given a second, third, fourth chance etc. He’ll always throw you a lifeline. Call on Him &amp; He will lift you out of your misery."
2193,2019-11-04 15:20:21+00:00,muftimenk,Give your kindness away without expecting anything back. Kindness is contagious. The person you’re being kind to benefits through your help &amp; you'll feel good for having helped someone. The world is made better through your kindness. Trust me when I say we need this badly today!
2194,2019-11-04 06:31:55+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will test you again &amp; again. So when you are afflicted with a trial, instead of placing your hopes in other humans who are equally weak, place your trust in the Almighty. Place your utmost trust in Him and watch how He will help you through unimaginable sources."
2195,2019-11-03 22:03:41+00:00,muftimenk,We’re all sinners. We all make mistakes. We falter. We trip. We fall. We repent &amp; seek forgiveness from our Merciful Lord. We don’t see ourselves as a failure. We learn from our mistakes. We refuse to entertain what Satan plants in our heads. We get up &amp; keep pressing forward.
2196,2019-11-03 07:42:53+00:00,muftimenk,"We hate delays. We want things to happen when we want them. But the truth is, behind every delay, there's some goodness. Don't regard every delay as negative. Remember, the Almighty knows what we don’t. There’s always some hidden good why certain things happen the way they do."
2197,2019-11-02 20:18:13+00:00,muftimenk,"For serious self-diagnosis to happen, we need honesty, faith &amp; hope. Don’t make excuses for our shortcoming, admit our flaws &amp; pray that the Almighty sees us through it. We have to accept that we are human &amp; we falter; yet we can improve ourselves with help from the Almighty!"
2198,2019-11-02 13:48:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you undertake in life, be it in business, marriage, etc don’t expect a perfect fit. If you do, you’re in for a huge disappointment. Learn to adapt to given situations. Construct a positive environment for yourself &amp; above all seek your strength from the Almighty."
2199,2019-11-02 06:37:23+00:00,muftimenk,"When dealing with negative people, protect yourself from becoming angry or frustrated. It’s not worth the heartache. Don’t retaliate; try to hold your tongue. Responding angrily feeds their negativity. Hold your tongue."
2200,2019-11-02 01:03:25+00:00,muftimenk,"When the whole world’s in deep slumber,
When you wake for the sole purpose of worshipping Him,
When you’re alone with Him, crying out, seeking His help &amp; forgiveness in the depths of the night
When you feel His Might over all else,
That’s a cure for your distressed heart!"
2201,2019-11-01 14:42:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever’s happening in your life, keep going. You didn’t come this far to just quit &amp; give it all up. Remember, the Almighty loves you &amp; will keep redirecting you to what has been planned for you. Even when you can’t see what’s ahead, take that leap of faith! Trust Him always!"
2202,2019-11-01 09:23:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Be prepared to be tested with fear, failure, loss, health, wealth. You can bear it with good patience or get upset &amp; miserable. What should keep you going is the thought that nothing lasts. The Almighty has a beautiful Paradise waiting for you. Don’t forsake that!"
2203,2019-10-31 23:15:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Grant us renewed strength for we can’t carry on alone. Our souls are tired, sapped by the worldly goings-on. Grant us the courage, wisdom and serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed. We know You have a plan for us and it’s a beautiful one. Aameen."
2204,2019-10-31 12:49:42+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is you don’t need many friends. As long as you have a few who are willing to go out of their way for you, you’re blessed. The one who will give you a lift when you’re feeling down; the one who won’t hurt you but who loves you unconditionally. Cherish such friends."
2205,2019-10-31 03:14:55+00:00,muftimenk,Make the Almighty your centre of focus every few minutes daily &amp; you will surely find ease in the hours that follow.

When your world is topsy-turvy,
When you can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel,
When your world seems to be crumbling, crashing down on you;
Always remember that a sincere prayer can change your entire life.
Where there’s hope, there is life"
2207,2019-10-29 20:20:38+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s common to look at how others are doing and feel like you’re not making much progress or worse, have remained stagnant.

2208,2019-10-29 14:01:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will create situations of hardship to see our reactions &amp; course of action. Do we bear good patience, take it in our stride &amp; use it to get closer to Him or do we lose the plot and start drifting away from HIm? The choice is yours. Remember, everything is temporary!"
2209,2019-10-29 03:38:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Many of us try so hard to be popular, accepted and liked by others. Often, we go out of our way to be the person others want us to be. We forget that’s not the goal; simply because you’ll never be able to please everyone. You’ll end up frustrated and miserable. Be yourself!"
2210,2019-10-28 16:40:43+00:00,muftimenk,"You are who you are when no one is looking. That’s the real you. The “you” that the Almighty knows, which others may not. Remember, it’s easy to be nice &amp; feel good when things are smooth &amp; ideal. The real “you” shows up when things  are crumbling &amp; nothing is going you way!"
2211,2019-10-28 03:31:03+00:00,muftimenk,"When you pray, pray wholeheartedly. Give it your all; as if it’s your last one. The Almighty knows and He is watching you. He knows how many distractions are vying for your attention &amp; pulling you away from prayer. So ignore Satan and stand before your Lord with great humility."
2212,2019-10-27 17:21:55+00:00,muftimenk,"We are all struggling one way or another. We feel stuck, often at our wits’ end; overwhelmed &amp; can’t seem to find a way out. Seek your strength from the Almighty through patience &amp; prayer. Keep asking. He never tires of hearing your supplication as long as you don’t give up!"
2213,2019-10-27 09:06:49+00:00,muftimenk,Most of the things you worry about in life are insignificant. Most of them you can’t  control anyway. It’s the Almighty’s way of showing you who is in charge. So focus on being the best version of yourself. Be a shining example for others to follow and hand over the rest to Him.
2214,2019-10-26 22:16:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit overthinking &amp; being anxious always. Trust the Almighty to be your Guide. There’s nothing like finding peace &amp; rest from all your troubles in Him. Your problems may still be present, but when you learn to trust Him, peace will reign in your heart. Seek comfort in Him alone."
2215,2019-10-26 15:49:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t give up on others because the Almighty never gives up on us. You can’t control people, making them do what’s right. You can only show the way. Guidance comes from the Almighty. So don’t be frustrated. Do your best and let Him take care of the rest. He guides whom He wills."
2216,2019-10-25 20:49:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Always choose love, kindness and forgiveness. Always choose to walk the high ground. Never mind what others say, never mind what rumours they choose to spread about you; never lose your cool and composure. Never tire of doing good. The Almighty loves  such consistent acts."
2217,2019-10-25 14:39:18+00:00,muftimenk,"People are quick to criticize. Always thank your critics. Even if he is harsh &amp; rude, thank him. He might have been having a bad day, or maybe he’s just a negative person in general. Take criticism positively. It’s a good thing for you anyway; a means of keeping yourself humble."
2218,2019-10-25 03:05:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We seek Your  forgiveness, especially on this blessed day as we are sinners &amp; have committed many sins. Only You can forgive all of them. May we always turn to You for strength to forgive others as well.  Shower us with Your Mercy which we so desperately need. Aameen."
2219,2019-10-24 21:11:37+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s not always what you say that matters. Knowing what not to say is equally important. Don’t feel like you have to respond to everyone &amp; take part in every discussion &amp; argument thrown your way.  Often, the best response in many situations is simply to remain silent. Peace!"
2220,2019-10-24 14:53:47+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s natural to feel sad. It’s part of being human. No matter how bad the situation, even if the suffering feels endless, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. The Almighty has promised us. He won’t burden us beyond our capacity. He will give us the strength that we need!"
2221,2019-10-24 05:56:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't become obsessed with social media. When the number of likes &amp; followers is your main focus, when your values &amp; morals are compromised or when you barely spend time with family or your Maker, then it's time to change. Slow down &amp; ponder! The successful prioritise correctly!"
2222,2019-10-23 23:10:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Many chase money, wealth, status, etc in life. But never have they found true contentment &amp; peace of mind from any of that, because the hearts are attached to the wrong thing. If you want a heart that’s content, develop a relationship with your Maker. Your soul will be at ease."
2223,2019-10-23 15:19:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t hate or begrudge someone who ignores you. If it makes them happy, so be it. Don’t let the behaviour of someone else affect you. You can’t change people. But you can go where you are appreciated. Remember, life has a way of dishing out to others what they dish out to you!"
2224,2019-10-23 05:13:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Your trials are meant to draw you closer to the Almighty; for you to acknowledge His Might &amp; Prowess. Only He can grant you relief. If they take you away from Him, you’ve failed the test. It’s important to understand His Plan so you don’t lose out on what’s in store for you!"
2225,2019-10-22 22:06:02+00:00,muftimenk,People are prone to conflicts. Some will find any excuse to get into arguments with those whose views differ from theirs. They will even take you to task. Don’t get into such battles. Keeping the peace is more important so long as your belief is not compromised.
2226,2019-10-22 11:12:38+00:00,muftimenk,"The hardest part of life’s journey is going through the unfamiliar or unknown because we don't know what to expect. But when you walk in firm faith, you no longer worry about what will happen down the road. Your heart trusts the Almighty. You know He has it all figured out!"
2227,2019-10-22 03:20:25+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let other people bring out the worst in you. You’re bound to meet them. These individuals may provoke you to say things you regret or pressure you to do things you wouldn't normally do. Stay true to your values and refuse to let others have a negative influence over you!
2228,2019-10-21 20:52:24+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t despair when you see others receive blessing after blessing &amp; have their prayers answered. Understand that the Almighty has a plan. He will respond when He feels the time is appropriate; when He feels that you’re ready to receive what you’ve been asking for! Patience!
2229,2019-10-21 13:22:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Social media makes you focus on what others have. You yearn for their lifestyle, their five-star holidays, palatial homes and perfect  families. You are immersed in something that’s not yours. Start focusing on what you have. Be grateful. You have a lot to be thankful for. A lot!"
2230,2019-10-21 05:53:10+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re my Creator, Provider, Cherisher, Bestower, Sustainer &amp; Curer.
You’re my source of strength &amp; wisdom. You’re my Eternal Refuge.
You’re my Guide &amp; Protector.
You’re my go-to in good &amp; bad times.
You’re the Lord of the Worlds.
You’re the One.
The Almighty."
2231,2019-10-20 19:00:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Never lose hope in His Mercy. To do so is an insult to the Almighty. It’s also a grave sin. Lay your trust in Him firmly &amp; always do your best in all that you undertake. Everything will work out in the end. It may not be how you planned it, but it’s certainly part of His Plan!"
2232,2019-10-20 11:08:12+00:00,muftimenk,Feeling stuck in life? Do you keep going round in circles? Then you have to stop doing what you’re doing &amp; take stock of your life. Reevaluate your priorities &amp; shift your mindset. Only then can you get out of the repetitive rut you’re in. Seek your strength from the Almighty
2233,2019-10-20 00:28:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Live your life one day at a time. Do your best &amp; be the best version of yourself, improving with each passing day. Don’t worry about tomorrow; let the Almighty take care of that. Remember, your journey is yours alone. Don’t be distracted. Pray for His guidance in all that you do!"
2234,2019-10-19 15:07:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes, when you get too comfortable &amp; things are too smooth, the Almighty will shake you out of your comfort zone. Don’t be alarmed. Read His signs. If you have a good attitude &amp; bear patience, He will grant you something that’s greater than you imagined."
2235,2019-10-19 07:12:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever pain you’re experiencing today will hold you in good stead tomorrow. The more you suffer today, the stronger you become. This life’s not a rosy bed. Tomorrow's success is based on today's discomfort. Patience, a strong willpower &amp; the right attitude will see you through."
2236,2019-10-19 00:36:12+00:00,muftimenk,It’s natural to feel tired and discouraged when life deals you a blow. We are generally weak and crumble with the slightest hardship. Always remember that you’re not alone. The Almighty will give you strength and power to overcome your difficulties. Trust Him completely.
2237,2019-10-18 14:12:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be insensitive towards the feelings of others. Learn to be empathetic &amp; feel for them. Put yourself in their shoes. Try at least. Sometimes it’s not what you do or say that is inconsiderate, it is the lack of it that hurts. Reach out to people. Listen more. Don’t judge."
2238,2019-10-18 02:22:03+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Protect us from those who are trying to harm us &amp; have bad intentions towards us. Keep our hearts from fear &amp; fill it with love &amp; goodness. You are indeed our refuge &amp; strength! Surround us with those who will empower us. May You always be our Guide &amp; watch over us!
2239,2019-10-17 16:44:32+00:00,muftimenk,It takes more than willpower to stop worrying. You know that because you’ve tried it. Yet you can’t seem to stop worrying. People who don’t know the Almighty &amp; how He works tend to worry more. Hand over what you can’t control to Him &amp; let Him take over. Lighten your load.
2240,2019-10-17 07:03:10+00:00,muftimenk,It’s a fact that your strength will offend some people. These are the ones who want to control &amp; manipulate you &amp; keep you bound! Don’t worry about them. They have no power over you! Only the Almighty does! Trust Him to take care of those who really need help. Remain steadfast!
2241,2019-10-16 18:43:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Social media can ruin your marriage. Put together your smart gadgets &amp; social media &amp; you have a volatile combination that can dominate your marriage &amp; control your life. Communication with your spouse should take priority. Don’t let anyone else, let alone your gadgets intervene!"
2242,2019-10-16 00:49:10+00:00,muftimenk,Choose peace over conflict. It’s a better way to go. Choose silence or choose to walk away from those who are always looking for a battle about someone or something. You can’t win even when it’s not about you. So don’t bother getting drawn into situations  that will drain you!
2243,2019-10-15 20:32:08+00:00,muftimenk,There are so many dissatisfied people around us. Those who are always quick to complain. They speak like the whole world owes them a living. Nothing good comes out of their mouths. They can ruin your day &amp; sap your energy. Try your best not to engage them. Pray for such people.
2244,2019-10-15 09:02:04+00:00,muftimenk,Getting close to the Almighty is not something that will happen overnight. It’s hard work. Set daily goals. Push yourself but be realistic. Pray. Do all that He’s  prescribed for you. Do your best. He knows you’re trying. But you have to make an effort. Keep going!
2245,2019-10-15 00:23:36+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s no reason to fear anyone other than the Almighty. Our sustenance is not determined by anyone but Him. When we understand this, it should lead to peace &amp; tranquility in our hearts. If we put our trust in Him alone, we know that everything is according to His Decree!"
2246,2019-10-14 07:21:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Our wisdom is limited. We can’t see beyond a certain point &amp; certainly not what lies ahead. Even when you don't understand all the details of the plan, the Almighty, with His Divine Wisdom, knows everything, right to the last detail. So why don’t we trust Him with our affairs?"
2247,2019-10-13 22:57:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop trying to please people. The truth is, you’ll never be good enough. Even at your best, they’ll find something to pick on. That’s the nature of Man. So stop sacrificing your happiness for people who don’t care much about you. Keep your heart attached to your Creator. Content!"
2248,2019-10-13 17:20:04+00:00,muftimenk,"As you climb the ladder of life, make sure it’s on solid ground. This represents your faith integrity and truth. Others will be jealous. Don’t worry about them. The only ones you should be looking at are the ones who are going in the same direction. Lift them up as well!"
2249,2019-10-13 06:28:39+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want ease in your life, don’t make things difficult for others. Treat people the way you want to be treated. What you consider small gestures of kindness can go a long way to ease tensions &amp; spread goodness. Always have the best manners; a trait of the people of Paradise!"
2250,2019-10-12 21:42:05+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want change, do it soonest possible. If you want to repent, do it now. Don’t wait. We often tell ourselves, there’s time to do it tomorrow. Don’t let Satan trick you. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone. Waiting is not an option so let us not delude ourselves any longer!"
2251,2019-10-12 14:23:54+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how complicated life gets, stay in your own lane. Don’t get involved in other people’s lives or their drama. They will try to get you on board &amp; make you take sides. Don’t. Let’s face it, life’s complicated enough. Focus and mind your own business. It’s less stressful!"
2252,2019-10-11 22:57:40+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s alright to disagree with someone. You don’t have to engage in an argument or get nasty about it. Politely decline to waste time arguing. You’re entitled to your opinion, just like the other person. Remember, the wise would always hold their tongue and keep the peace."
2253,2019-10-11 16:41:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit worrying about the problematic people in your life. The troublesome ones, the petty ones who are trying to hold you back &amp; create unease. Let the Almighty take care of them. He knows how to move the wrong people out of your life and bring the right people in. Trust Him!"
2254,2019-10-11 12:28:27+00:00,muftimenk,Discipline your mind to focus on what truly matters. Let’s face it; there’s so much clutter in our minds because we all suffer from information overload. Focus on the issues and people who matter. Let go of things which are of no consequence. You’ll enrich your life that way!
2255,2019-10-11 03:42:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us a steadfast faith &amp; complete trust in You in this uncertain world; knowing that You’ll protect us, come what may. Guard us from temptation &amp; those who’d try to make us compromise our convictions. Let us not attach our hearts to this temporary world. Aameen."
2256,2019-10-10 22:37:39+00:00,muftimenk,"If there are people in your life who treat you poorly and try to make you feel like you are less than enough, or that you need to prove your worth in some way, keep your distance from them. Spend time instead with people who lift you up. Keep your heart attached  to your Maker."
2257,2019-10-10 10:21:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Pray for those who hide their sufferings from the rest of the world. They always have a smile for you &amp; you end up thinking they’re completely fine. These are the ones who spend their nights crying out to their Lord, begging for His Mercy and relief from their trials. Respect!"
2258,2019-10-10 03:42:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever others may have done to you, don’t let their actions  turn you cold on the inside. More importantly, don’t let it make you unkind. Seek comfort and solace in the Almighty.  Cry your heart out, be sad but get up again. Learn from the experience but don’t become bitter!"
2259,2019-10-09 20:47:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the one who dilutes his faith just to appease the masses. You may think you’re getting away with it but remember, the Almighty is All-Knowing. There’s no such thing as going with the flow in matters of faith. Make the Almighty your priority. You will be truly prosperous!"
2260,2019-10-09 13:36:54+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s good in every hardship. Recognise the signs. The days you were broke because you lost your job, the days you grieved because you lost a loved one, the days you wanted to give it all up was the time you found something priceless. You found your strength in the Almighty!"
2261,2019-10-09 04:30:22+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re feeling stuck and down in the dumps often, ask yourself, are you focusing on disappointments? Becaus if you are, you won’t be able to move forward. You’ll feel a heavy load on your back. Let go of whatever it is that’s holding you back. Forgive and move on."
2262,2019-10-08 18:13:52+00:00,muftimenk,Giving is good. It gives you a sense of purpose. But there are those who will squeeze every drop of goodness from you. That’s where you need to draw the line. Selfless giving can become overwhelming. It’s good to give more than you receive but keep your own interests in sight!
2263,2019-10-08 06:31:11+00:00,muftimenk,"We had no say when we came into this world &amp; we have no say when we’ll leave this earth. Yet, we behave as if we know it all. We trudge the earth arrogantly without sparing a thought for others! Humble yourself. If you don’t, the Almighty will surely send some lessons your way!"
2264,2019-10-07 10:31:44+00:00,muftimenk,There are people who enjoy putting others down. It’s a cruel way of making someone else seem less important than you. Avoid reacting immediately &amp; don’t retaliate. Deal with it in your own time.  You could also ignore it because silence can be the best weapon at times!
2265,2019-10-07 04:34:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Social media is making us anti-social. We’ve become so engrossed in technology &amp; mostly our smartphones, that at times we become quite oblivious to our surroundings. If you feel you’re not being social enough, get off your devices, turn off your phone. Give it a try today!"
2266,2019-10-06 23:25:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t use your children as pawns in your divorce. Many do it &amp; the children suffer in the end. Communicate with the ex, set guidelines on child maintenance. Make sure you stop to consider how your actions are going to affect your children before you engage in them. Have a heart!"
2267,2019-10-06 11:12:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you trust your Creator? As in fully trust the Almighty to turn your life around? Some people always feel anxious, wondering what's ahead of them. They panic. They forget who’s in control of their lives. He wants you to keep your mind focused on Him. He will see you through it."
2268,2019-10-06 02:51:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t think that bad things happen only to you. They happen to everyone. Every single day. The difference lies in how you deal with any given situation. Your attitude counts. If you choose to see things in a positive light, then you’ll rise above it and overcome it eventually."
2269,2019-10-05 15:58:36+00:00,muftimenk,"When people misunderstand &amp; reject you, don’t feel miserable. It’s bound to happen sooner or later. It’s part of the Almighty’s plan to make you realize that you shouldn’t rely on His Creation but only on the One who created you. People will let you down but He will lift you!"
2270,2019-10-05 07:55:44+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t make the mistake of telling someone too much about yourself. Over sharing is bad. It can invite negative energy  from those who don’t want good for you. They will use the information in a way that can be detrimental to you. Share selectively only with those who truly care.
2271,2019-10-04 23:24:41+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty did not create us to become popular with everyone and to live up to their expectations. No! We’re here to worship our Creator and be the best we can in this short life. If you find yourself deviating from this main goal, you’ll end up miserable. Get back on track!"
2272,2019-10-04 16:26:09+00:00,muftimenk,Stay firm &amp; resolute. Don’t let circumstances sway your faith like a candle in the wind. Never doubt that the Almighty’s aware of everything that’s going on in your life. Don’t let others create doubts in your mind. He has brought you this far. Do you think He’ll abandon you?
2273,2019-10-04 16:25:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Today's Friday Sermon from Harare, Zimbabwe 

https://t.co/jTnqOPmFcw"
2274,2019-10-04 03:46:57+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Help us understand what is really happening in our lives. Give us the strength to surpass all the trials and problems that are coming our way. We’re doing our best. Remove every obstacle that prevents us from getting closer to You. Lead us to the path of righteousness.
2275,2019-10-03 22:33:20+00:00,muftimenk,You can dream all you want but if there’s no action to realise those dreams then it amounts to nothing. Be proactive. Walk the talk. That’s the only way people will respect you. Words that don’t translate into action remain mere words. This life’s too short to waste like that!
2276,2019-10-03 16:04:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feel like you have to take part in every conversation and every argument. Often people will draw you into it, egging you to take sides. Don’t. Exercise restraint. Be smart enough to know when to speak and when to remain silent. It will save you from a whole lot of trouble."
2277,2019-10-03 08:03:47+00:00,muftimenk,"If you are often stressed, anxious, feel like a failure or you're not doing what you think you should be doing, consider this. Start helping others. You’ll feel a sense of self-worth that you’re actually making a difference &amp; easing someone’s load. See how your life changes!"
2278,2019-10-02 22:16:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you can’t do it, doesn’t mean the Almighty can’t do it! He’s the Lord of the Worlds. If He can turn night into day &amp; have perfect synchronisation in things around us, He can surely  change our situation in the blink of an eye. He’ll do it when He knows you’re ready!"
2279,2019-10-02 13:01:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Many people find it hard to let go of past disappointments, regrets and losses. They keep revisiting old wounds. They keep thinking of what-ifs. Honestly, what good does it do? Learn the lesson. Move on. Get your gaze up onto the horizon and embrace what the Almighty has for you!"
2280,2019-10-02 05:33:40+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty will get you there. Never doubt that. He will open doors you never imagined; place the right people in your path and grant you the ability to move on henceforth. You need to trust Him and do the best you can. Understand His Plan and read His signs. You’ll be okay!
2281,2019-10-01 23:19:05+00:00,muftimenk,We may not understand why some things happen. Embrace them anyway.  Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives happened when we weren’t sure what was going on . Life is what we make of it. The Almighty is watching how we respond. Thank Him upon all conditions. Always.
2282,2019-10-01 16:18:03+00:00,muftimenk,"We all have a fixed time in our lives. Why is it that some are able to achieve much more than others? That’s because so many people run out of focus, discipline &amp; determination. They just go with the flow, talk a lot &amp; expect things to fall into place without lifting a finger!"
2283,2019-10-01 06:40:42+00:00,muftimenk,We live in an age of envy; social media has created a world in which everyone else seems happy but you. You’re finding it hard to come to terms with it. You can’t achieve the lifestyle you want but which you see others have. You need to get back to reality! Stop the comparison!
2284,2019-09-30 21:26:14+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s so much negativity in the world around us that it’s so easy to feel down. Get hold of yourself. Don't let your burdens drown you. Don’t let your trials make you think there’s no way out. Remember, nothing lasts. Start focussing on your blessings, no matter how small."
2285,2019-09-30 15:18:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Change is not easy. Change is hard work. Change requires discipline, focus, single-mindedness, commitment. But the truth is, if you are obsessed with results, you will never change. You’ll get nowhere. Focus instead on change &amp; you’re more likely to get the results that you want."
2286,2019-09-30 03:46:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Why is the Almighty taking so long to respond? We hear this almost daily.  We’ve wept, we’ve begged, cried our hearts out, but still He’s not answering. Why? Because He, with His Divine and Infinite Wisdom operates on His schedule.  But remember, your patience is your Paradise!"
2287,2019-09-29 20:09:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Always ask the Almighty to make you a blessing wherever you go. Let’s admit it. There are many out there who are plain downright painful to be around with. They make life difficult for others, behave in a demanding way &amp; make it seem like the other person is the problematic one!"
2288,2019-09-29 09:56:20+00:00,muftimenk,Be wary of toxic people. They are the ones who always blame others for everything that happens so that they don’t have to take accountability for their own behaviour. They act like the whole world owes them a living! They will sap your energy. Let the Almighty take over. Peace!
2289,2019-09-28 10:47:32+00:00,muftimenk,"When you hold on to hate, you allow people from your past to continue to hurt you. That’s not a wise move. People from your past should stay in the past. They can’t continue to hurt you unless you hold on to the hurt. Let go and let the Almighty deal with them. Lighten your load."
2290,2019-09-28 03:43:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t engage petty, small-minded people. They tend to give others a hard time with their perceptions of life; trapped in their own little cocoons. If you do not conform to their notions of life, you’re deemed wrong! Don’t get involved with such people. Pray for them to be guided!"
2291,2019-09-27 14:22:07+00:00,muftimenk,"In today’s world, we are obsessed with figures. The number of followers, the number of likes, the number of friends &amp; so on. Dig deeper beneath those figures &amp; there’s an important message. Do not count the number of friends you have but the number of friends you can count on."

https://t.co/dnuf7dcR88"
2293,2019-09-27 03:46:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Whenever we’re stressed, anxious or afraid, help us remember to run to You and no one else. You’re the only One who can calm our fears, anxieties and turbulent hearts. We can’t handle these times alone. We need Your peace &amp; infinite wisdom to guide us through it all."
2294,2019-09-26 22:24:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Rather than reaching out and hitting back at the person who is irritating you, learn to exercise restraint. Remind yourself that the Almighty rewards the one who is patient and watches over all things. As long as you are pleasing Him, don’t fret. Nobody can cause you any harm."
2295,2019-09-26 14:06:28+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty exposes someone’s intention towards you, He has done it for a reason. Some will act like they care about you but behind your back, their intent is totally the opposite. They may even harbour ill thoughts towards you. But don’t worry. The truth will always out!"
2296,2019-09-26 04:27:09+00:00,muftimenk,It’s natural to feel unsure and uncertain about what life has to offer. We’re human after all. Come to terms with it but don’t let it engulf you. Rise above it because you know that the Almighty has your back always. Take a deep breath and move forward. There’s no other way!
2297,2019-09-25 22:54:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Never mind how they choose to treat you. You walk the higher ground.  Don’t stoop to their level. Treat people with respect and honour. Treat them with love and kindness. Why should you? For a simple reason that what you do will find its way back to you. Somehow, someday."
2298,2019-09-25 08:39:46+00:00,muftimenk,"When you spread kindness, you’re actually giving the person strength. You’re not reminding him of his weakness. You’re empowering him to go forth and do what he has to do. You’re giving value to other people without expecting anything in return. That’s surely a good thing!"
2299,2019-09-24 18:40:53+00:00,muftimenk,People have microscopic vision when it comes to the flaws of others. Nothing escapes their eyes. They’ll pick on the minutest blemish &amp; find fault with it but will stay clear of their own shortcomings. Staying away from that which doesn’t concern you is a good rule to live by!
2300,2019-09-24 03:59:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Blessed is he who keeps enduring test after test, who firmly believes &amp; puts his trust in the Almighty. No matter what test comes his way, he will endure with good patience because he knows the Almighty is in full control. Such people will have a special place on Judgement Day."
2301,2019-09-23 17:02:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Life isn’t easy. It hurts. It’s difficult. It’s tough to imagine the uncertainties. But you know what? The Almighty is planning so much behind the scenes. He will unfold them when the time is right. May be tomorrow, perhaps another day. Be patient. You’ll emerge stronger."
2302,2019-09-23 09:39:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Ups and downs are part of our daily occurrence. Instead of letting it sour your day, thank the Almighty. Don’t fret. He’s using every test and every trial to refine you. And He will keep doing it till you pass the test and are ready to move on.  So take it in your stride."
2303,2019-09-22 20:47:59+00:00,muftimenk,Some people can’t bear to see you having a good life &amp; being blessed. They will want to spoil things for you. Beware such people. They won’t hesitate to stab you in your back as well. Learn to be unconditionally happy for those the Almighty has blessed. Your turn will come.
2304,2019-09-22 12:54:11+00:00,muftimenk,"@nasseralqtami اللهم اشفه يا شافي اللهم عافه
May the Almighty, the Owner of cure, cure him! Aameen"
2305,2019-09-22 04:12:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing that happens in your life is by accident. The Almighty plans everything to the finest detail. There’s a reason behind every incident. Sooner or later, the reason will become apparent. Spend time understanding His Plan. You’ll feel a lot better about your life."
2306,2019-09-21 22:02:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Often when people talk about change, they mean a physical change. Changing how you look doesn’t count if you’re still carrying on with bad habits etc. Real change comes from within. It means working on yourself from the inside starting with your heart, the root of most problems!"
2307,2019-09-21 12:25:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone makes a mistake &amp; then apologizes, accept it &amp; move on. It’s a teachable moment for us all. Be magnanimous. There’s no need to analyze it &amp; tear the person down. It takes a lot of guts to admit you’re wrong. But with the right attitude, you can move on &amp; grow!"
2308,2019-09-21 04:17:49+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want to criticize others, do so constructively. It’s easy to just shoot from the hip and say anything that comes to mind. By doing so, you’re dragging the person down. But it takes a mature soul to actually want to correct someone; to see him become a better person."
2309,2019-09-20 18:50:35+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, friends &amp; loved ones are the ones who hurt us most. Considering the nature of these relationships, some incidents can leave a deep wound, threatening to uproot friendships &amp; harm family ties. Turn to the Almighty; only He can help you in finding forgiveness for them."
2310,2019-09-20 06:04:30+00:00,muftimenk,"The difficult people in your life can be your greatest teacher.  Be grateful for the lesson they’re teaching you; those who push your buttons, annoy you with their antics give you the greatest chance for personal growth. Remember, you don’t grow when it’s all comfortable &amp; good."
2311,2019-09-19 22:57:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Only You know the trials and tribulations we are facing in this life. Only You know our pain and understand our discomfort. Only You are there for our grief and sorrow. Only You have the power to heal us, grant hope in our hearts and make us feel whole again. Aameen."
2312,2019-09-19 15:24:49+00:00,muftimenk,Are you prepared to face your Maker? Are you prepared for your first night in the grave &amp; your life in there which will be much longer than here on earth? Are you prepared to account for all your deeds? If your answer is no... Are you then prepared to start preparing for death?
2313,2019-09-19 06:18:39+00:00,muftimenk,"When helping others, do so sincerely, from your heart, not expecting anything in return from them. Do it with utmost respect, not in a derogatory way, making them feel small or less in stature. Maintain dignity and self-respect at all times. May the Almighty accept our deeds!"
2314,2019-09-18 22:38:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Never forget that Satan is a big enemy. He loves it when we are at loggerheads with people. He loves it when there’s unrest, fighting, arguing, lots of turmoil everywhere. So protect yourself and do your best not to get drawn into such situations where there is disunity."
2315,2019-09-18 14:34:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Suicide is NOT an option! When you’re in the depths of despair,  remember, to prolong your prayer and confide in Him. He knows what you’re going through. He will never burden you with more than you can bear. Keep your heart firmly atttached to Him. He will find a way out."
2316,2019-09-18 05:18:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't allow your circumstances to dictate your feelings. When you accept the Almighty’s Decree fully, you have the right attitude towards difficulties or bad news. You accept there’s good in everything eventually. You’re able to walk firmly &amp; steadily. You have firm faith in Him."
2317,2019-09-17 22:26:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Let hatred go
Let envy go 
Let grudges go
Let self-doubt go
Let low self-esteem go 
Let toxic thoughts go
Let negativity go
Let inner peace prevail
Let your heart be light."
2318,2019-09-17 14:27:37+00:00,muftimenk,"We change many things in our lives, almost on a daily basis. In fact, change is the only constant today. From physical appearance to our jobs, things are changing. So why do we cling on to our thoughts, ideas, notions, perceptions &amp; mindset which serve no purpose? Let them go!"
2319,2019-09-17 05:57:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Spreading rumours and gossip is incredibly dangerous. It destroys reputations, breaks down relationships and causes mayhem in someone’s life. It’s so common today because so many have lost basic decency and wouldn’t bat an eyelid mass texting such messages. Be careful!"
2320,2019-09-16 18:43:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus on the right things. Things that matter. Not on other people's lives, their drama, problems &amp; behaviour. All that isn’t your business. You need to fix what needs fixing in your life. Don’t be distracted. Don’t compare your life to others. Circumstances are never the same."
2321,2019-09-16 07:16:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people love to make fun of others &amp; humiliate them in public. They lack social manners &amp; some are plain downright rude. They are perhaps unaware that no one has the right to humiliate or hurt another. Besides, the one humiliated may be closer to the Almighty. Be mindful."
2322,2019-09-15 22:12:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep reminding yourself that you can’t control people’s thoughts and actions. You don’t have to engage every critic, rebutt every point, win every argument or prove them wrong. Let them say what they will. Channel your energy towards more productive things. Don’t lose focus!"
2323,2019-09-15 16:10:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Avoid the trap of not treasuring what you truly have. Many make this mistake in life. You’ll end up losing what is really precious. Remember, some things in life can’t be fixed once they’re broken. Time doesn’t heal all wounds. You don’t want to lose what you value the most!"
2324,2019-09-15 03:51:26+00:00,muftimenk,"How you treat people &amp; what you do for them will, in no way, guarantee any form of reciprocation on their part. Some may even take you for granted. That’s the nature of man. Don’t despair because the Almighty is aware of every single deed, no matter how small they may appear."
2325,2019-09-14 17:08:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is not a sprint but a long, arduous ordeal, a marathon. If you don’t pace yourself you will burn out. So keep a steady pace and keep your focus on the road ahead. Remember, as long as you’re doing your part, the Almighty will do the rest. Don’t stress too much. Keep going."
2326,2019-09-14 08:19:08+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all had things done to us by other people. For some, they want to settle the score and seek revenge; although we have been taught not to repay evil with evil. Revenge can backfire. The best way to seek justice is often to leave it to the Almighty!"
2327,2019-09-13 20:38:08+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re going through a rough patch, a difficult time, know that you're not alone. That’s life, with all its ups and downs. Embrace it. What you’re going through is not peculiar to you. Everyone has a story to tell, a wound to heal or a scar to show. So keep your chin up!"
2328,2019-09-13 14:17:44+00:00,muftimenk,"The nicest people are empathetic. They put themselves in everyone’s shoes. They know how bad it feels  to be mocked at, ridiculed and made fun of. They understand that life has its moments. They try to help people overcome their struggles and spread kindness in their path."
2329,2019-09-13 04:56:26+00:00,muftimenk,The problem with some is they get so fixated with what they want that they overlook what they have. Be careful. This is how ingratitude sets in. It starts small and it grows to the point that you pursue what you want relentlessly at the expense of those around you. Be mindful!
2330,2019-09-12 22:52:18+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Thank you for always being there. Some days feel too hard. We’re hurting. Struggling. Fighting fear &amp; worry at every turn. You’re the only One who can turn hearts around. You’re our Healer. Nothing is too difficult for you. Strengthen our conviction in You.
2331,2019-09-12 12:06:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When one door closes, don't despair. Another ten are opened but we often refuse to see them. Perhaps the door you wanted to enter from would not have led you to the success you imagined. Trust the Almighty. He steers you towards success even when you think He has abandoned you."
2332,2019-09-12 05:48:51+00:00,muftimenk,"At times you will feel like your faith is being tested. Your soul is tired. You start questioning things. You’re doubtful. You’re fearful. This is all part of the Almighty’s Plan. But remember, He will never burden you with more than you can bear. Trust Him with all your heart!"
2333,2019-09-11 14:38:48+00:00,muftimenk,"They say old habits die hard. Do not go back to your old ways, no matter what you’re experiencing in life. Toxic habits, negative people and negative energy always tend to make a come back when you are doing better in life. Don’t neglect your link with your Maker. Stay focused!"
2334,2019-09-11 03:32:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Positivity is contagious, so is negativity. Make sure you’re spreading what’s positive. Only then will you be able to attract something similar. It’s not a coincidence that the day will appear brighter when you’re brimming with positivity and hope! Keep it alive in your heart!"
2335,2019-09-10 16:40:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Your pain, your struggles, your  hardship will always lead to strength. Yes. Without a doubt. They aren’t random events but carefully planned by the Almighty. The Best Planner. They have a beautiful purpose. They will lift you, strengthen you and mould you. Embrace them."
2336,2019-09-10 06:08:48+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve been wronged you expect an apology. At times, it doesn’t come. If a person doesn’t apologize, it’s not because they don't believe they made a mess, but perhaps because they just don't know how. That’s a fact. Try not to take it personally! Forgive them. Move on."
2337,2019-09-09 22:59:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Always ask the Almighty to make our intentions pure, our words honest and our actions sincere. Don’t taint what the Almighty has given us with arrogance. Always humble yourself. It doesn’t matter how powerful you are, king or commoner, your grave will be similar."
2338,2019-09-09 15:36:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Sad is he who thinks he has done many good deeds only to find out on Judgement Day that he has lost them all through backbiting, gossiping, slandering and showing up the faults of others. Stay away from these evil acts. Mind your own turf and you will reap the rewards!"
2339,2019-09-09 09:19:29+00:00,muftimenk,Losing someone you love is one of the biggest tests in life. You’ll have to carry on without the one you thought you could never live without. Allow yourself time to grieve. The pain &amp; heartache will serve as reminders. Submit to the Almighty’s Decree. He will grant you ease.
2340,2019-09-08 20:05:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Contentment is the greatest remedy for stress. People under stress will pay enormous amounts of money to alleviate their pain, whether through drugs or therapy. Yet, a believer who’s content with the Almighty's Decree finds a greater relief, without spending even a cent!"
2341,2019-09-08 06:55:18+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how tired you are, how much you’re struggling, keep moving closer towards the Almighty. Remember, our hearts and faith are constantly shifting. Don’t let Satan take control. Try your best to keep on the straight path always. It won’t be easy but it will be worth it!"
2342,2019-09-07 22:22:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste your effort worrying about what people will think or say about you. It’s a futile exercise and it’s wrong to waste precious time like that. Instead, use that time wisely; do meaningful work, help someone. Spread goodness &amp; kindness which can have a ripple effect!"
2343,2019-09-07 15:58:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When people show you their true colours, take heed. The trouble is we try to convince ourselves that they’re not what they've proven to be and we end up getting hurt. This is foolish. Read the signs that the Almighty sends you and be alert. It could save you from so much trouble."
2344,2019-09-07 05:42:34+00:00,muftimenk,Gossip is verbal poison. It aims to defame &amp; discredit. It’s hurtful &amp; dangerous. It’s the quickest way to destroy trust. Don’t take it lightly. You may think it’s harmless but you’re actually ruining someone’s reputation. You’ll pay a high price! The Almighty will see to it!
2345,2019-09-06 22:39:18+00:00,muftimenk,"People who have the most time on their hands are the ones most likely to plot &amp; plan to bring others down. They have all the time to discuss the lives of others &amp; spread rumours. If you busy yourself with your own life &amp; helping others, you won’t have time for anything else."
2346,2019-09-06 13:16:10+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty loves those who ask Him. You’re better off complaining to Him than to humans. He will never betray you, He will never let you down, He will never look down on you. He is the only one who can answer your needs. Stop depending on humans unless you want to be let down!"
2347,2019-09-05 22:04:47+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. We ask You to grant us peace of mind and calm our troubled hearts. We can’t seem to find the balance we need in our lives so we stumble and worry constantly. Give us the strength and clarity of mind to walk the straight path You’ve laid out for us. Keep Satan at bay!
2348,2019-09-05 16:18:15+00:00,muftimenk,We all sin. We all make mistakes. We've all fallen short. The biggest mistake we could make is to lose hope &amp; dwell on our sins. That’s exactly what Satan wants us to do. Be quick to repent &amp; get back on track. Don’t stay down. Never lose hope in the Almighty’s Mercy. It’s a sin.
2349,2019-09-05 11:04:58+00:00,muftimenk,Your time with the Almighty is non-negotiable. Don’t try and cut corners with Him. He deserves your all and more as your Creator. Don’t make excuses and think you can take advantage of His ever merciful attribute. He knows what’s in your heart. He knows your intent!
2350,2019-09-05 04:35:14+00:00,muftimenk,Take failure in your stride. We all fail. Even champions do. Every failure is preparing you for what’s to come. Bigger. Better. Don’t be afraid to fail. You’ll learn more through failure than everything else. It will strengthen you. It will empower you. It will make you grow.
2351,2019-09-04 22:00:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be ashamed of the scars you get in life. They are proof of your inner strength. It shows you've lived your life fully; how you picked yourself up when you fell, how you handled defeat, darkness &amp; storms. Remember, the journey is important. But what matters is the end."
2352,2019-09-04 15:03:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t wait for the apology from the one who has wronged you. It may never come. Protect yourself and let go of the hurt. Get the closure your heart needs. Remember, every trial will change you. If you use it to get closer to the Almighty, you’ll end up a stronger, better person."
2353,2019-09-04 03:44:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Constantly remind yourself how short and fragile this life is. Take nothing and no one for granted. Appreciate everything, do your best under any given situation. Don’t give up and keep going. Most importantly, keep peace in your soul!"
2354,2019-09-03 19:00:34+00:00,muftimenk,"They'll pick on you. They'll judge you. They'll think the worst of you. They'll hate on you. They'll spread rumour about you. They'll abuse you. They'll wish you didn't exist! Yet through all of that, the Almighty will make you rise &amp; shine above them all. So keep smiling!"
2355,2019-09-03 18:58:46+00:00,muftimenk,"They'll pick on you. They'll judge you. They'll think the worst of you. They'll hate on you. They'll spread rumour about you. They'll abuse you. They'll wish you didn't exist! Yet through all of that, the Almighty will make you to rise &amp; shine above them all. So keep smiling!"
2356,2019-09-03 11:44:39+00:00,muftimenk,There are many who are sad and disillusioned because they fail to appreciate what the Almighty has bestowed on them. They scoff at His Blessings because they are too busy admiring the fake life portrayed by some on social media. Show gratitude before it’s taken away from you!
2357,2019-09-03 02:21:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Life will never be easy. The Almighty has promised that He will test us. Again &amp; again. So pray for strength &amp; resilience to withstand what lies ahead. Pray that He grants us patience, wisdom &amp; understanding to go through whatever challenges &amp; tribulations that come our way."
2358,2019-09-02 17:15:13+00:00,muftimenk,Talk is easy. Talk is cheap. But the real test is whether we put our words into action. Think of the consequences of what we’re saying and whether it’s beneficial. Remember that our words have power and what we say can affect people around us. So choose your words wisely!
2359,2019-09-02 07:11:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Humbling yourself is not easy, especially when everything around you tells you to make it about “me, me, me!” Stepping away from your pride, however, is a necessary step to living a life that’s meaningful. Help others, listen more. Make it about the other person for a change!"
2360,2019-09-01 23:24:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Wasting time is worse than wasting money. Some will have more money than others. But we all have twenty four hours in a day. It’s not possible to buy more time! Remember, money can be earned. It comes back to you. But a wasted minute is gone forever! So use your time wisely!"
2361,2019-09-01 16:16:37+00:00,muftimenk,Pain and fear. We’ve all experienced them without exception. How we approach it will determine how we live our lives. Do you allow it to paralyze you such that moving forward becomes a chore? Don’t let your pain and fear define you. Use them to spur you to greater heights.
2362,2019-09-01 12:21:31+00:00,muftimenk,Are Mufti Menk's tweets too long?
2363,2019-09-01 09:44:22+00:00,muftimenk,"It's always easy to make things more problematic and negative than they really are. The next time you catch yourself making a mountain out of a molehill, ask yourself how much of it will matter in five years. Or, even next month. Change your mindset so you don’t overthink!"
2364,2019-09-01 04:40:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Pay attention to what you’re focusing on most of the time. Listen to what you’re saying. How much time do you devote to petty, mindless &amp; negative things? There’s only so much you can take on in a day. Be selective. Focus on the positives, on things that matter in the long run."
2365,2019-08-31 19:59:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Maturity is when you stop complaining, making excuses &amp; blaming others for what’s going on in your life. It’s easy to look for scapegoats. But a mature person realizes that whatever happens is a result of choices made. For change to occur, you need to make new choices!"
2366,2019-08-31 11:59:21+00:00,muftimenk,"When you don’t understand the Almighty’s Plan, you’re more likely to lose hope &amp; feel despondent. You think you’re doing everything wrong &amp; you’re unsure about what lies ahead. But don’t give up. Keep asking Him. He’s All-Knowing. He will steer you in the right direction."
2367,2019-08-31 06:07:17+00:00,muftimenk,"If you feel stifled because you have the wrong people in your life right now, don’t despair. The Almighty is All-Knowing . He will move them out of your life and allow the right ones to cross your path. He will guide you to it. It’s a matter of time. You have to trust Him!"
2368,2019-08-30 19:35:02+00:00,muftimenk,"This life is a maze. At times, you may feel confronted with so many options. You have to figure out your route. What works for you may not work for someone else.  Chart your own path. Whichever way you go, keep moving, even if you seem stuck. There’s always a way out. Trust Him!"
2369,2019-08-30 14:49:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be a prisoner of your past. That part of your life’s over. The mistakes you made, the bad decisions, the unwise choices; they’re all part of life. Don’t dwell on it. They don’t define your future. Your future is a clean slate. Start writing on it! Be sure to write well."
2370,2019-08-30 07:17:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Time is precious. But equally precious is who you spend it with. If you’re with the wrong company, wasting time without any regard for the minutes ticking by, you’ll regret it one day. Always be conscious of time &amp; how you use it because once it’s gone, it’s gone forever."
2371,2019-08-29 22:44:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Help us think of death often. Remind us constantly that our lives can end in a heartbeat. Young or old, when it’s time to go, we go. Help us think of the day when we’ll be meeting You. Let us be prepared &amp; not waste time in this temporary world."
2372,2019-08-29 14:16:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Today we face trials from every direction. It’s easy to feel sad &amp; hopeless. But if your heart has sound trust in the Almighty, you won't despair; &amp; if you're sad, be comforted knowing that nothing lasts. Be patient. Ask Him to lighten your load. Trust Him. He knows what's best!"
2373,2019-08-29 00:04:40+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty knows your soul is tired. He knows you find it hard to accept what’s going on. He knows you’ve been asking Him &amp; praying hard. He knows you’re confused &amp; in need of comfort. But He also knows what’s best for you. He will always steer you in that direction. Trust Him.
2374,2019-08-28 09:05:50+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what situation you find yourself in, do not allow people's words, opinions and judgment to affect how you view yourself. By allowing it, you’re practically giving them full control over you. That is an unwise move. Learn to guard your own responses and actions!"
2375,2019-08-27 21:29:46+00:00,muftimenk,"We are no strangers to storms in our lives. Some big, some small. But no matter what happens, if you’re connected to the Almighty, He will prove to be the only anchor you need during any storm. Make Him the centre of focus. Rest assured you will be in His care always."
2376,2019-08-27 10:07:57+00:00,muftimenk,There’ll be good days and bad days. Sad days and happy days. There are some days where you’ll feel like you can achieve so much while other days make you feel completely useless. But there is never a day where you doubt that the Almighty wants only good for us! Trust Him!
2377,2019-08-27 04:02:54+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty rewards His servants in a manner similar to the deeds that they perform. If you’re helping someone, He will help you in return. He promises to be our Helper if we help one another. Who could be a better helper than The Lord of the Worlds? He’s all we need in the end!"
2378,2019-08-26 21:40:24+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant victory to the oppressed wherever they are. Those who have been driven out of their homes or wronged in any way. Grant ease to those who are struggling. Strengthen the weak &amp; downtrodden. You know best who they are &amp; where they are! Every one of them. Aameen.
2379,2019-08-26 16:51:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Take ownership of your life. Be accountable for everything that happens. Everything. Not just the good things. Remember, when things are going well, it’s easy. It’s all good and smooth sailing. The real test is when you’re facing trials. How you respond then, shows the real you!"
2380,2019-08-26 10:59:46+00:00,muftimenk,Those who are jealous of you will always tell you don’t bother doing certain things because you aren’t good enough. Ignore them. The Almighty has fully equipped you and empowered you to overcome whatever needs to be done. Don’t let such comments set you back. Keep moving forward.
2381,2019-08-26 05:24:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be frustrated by people’s criticisms and comments. If they’re constructive, you can learn from them. Otherwise, treat them as just noise. Don’t let it affect you and the good work that you do. Remember, your job is to please the Almighty. Don’t give others any attention!"
2382,2019-08-25 14:58:08+00:00,muftimenk,"If your life is not heading in the direction that you want, it’s time to change your outlook towards things. Perspective is important. Instead of looking at everyone else as the problem, look inside yourself. Identify your shortcomings and start working on them constructively."
2383,2019-08-25 04:08:33+00:00,muftimenk,Many people love to complain. Nothing is good enough for them. They’re never short of topics or issues to nitpick. There’s always something wrong or not good enough. They often have a poor mindset &amp; are filled with negativity. Don’t allow them to distract you from your focus.
2384,2019-08-24 18:18:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be consumed by materialism. The trouble is you’ll never have enough. As a result, you can be easily controlled by those who are wealthy and have a lot to offer. Stop comparing yourself with others. Learn to be content and remember, material things will NOT make you happy."
2385,2019-08-24 10:15:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember there’s no problem that cannot be solved or resolved. Life throws us curveballs on occasions and more often than not, what we worry about is not even important in the long term. Always seek guidance and strength from the One who has the answer to all our problems!"
2386,2019-08-24 05:09:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t curse a bad experience or tragedy that happened in your life. Remember, everything is designed by the Almighty so you can learn life lessons and move forward readily. The best thing you can do is to embrace it and put it to good use. He only wants the best for you!"
2387,2019-08-23 19:46:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, those who are hurting are at times the ones who hurt others as a result of their own pain. They struggle to cope with their hurt &amp; end up inflicting their anger or resentment towards others. So don’t retaliate. Stay calm &amp; help them if you can or stay away from them."
2388,2019-08-23 13:17:25+00:00,muftimenk,You’re disappointed not because of other people’s behavior but because of your own expectations. It’s a fact that people will let you down. Again &amp; again. They’ll show you their true colours eventually. Learn to expect only from the One who made you. The Almighty always delivers!
2389,2019-08-23 02:55:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Help us to let go of the harmful things we don’t understand, people who take advantage of us &amp; disappoint us &amp; those with evil intent towards us. Help us to unload the weary weight off our shoulders &amp; embrace the good You have put in our path. Aameen."
2390,2019-08-22 17:36:39+00:00,muftimenk,Everything that’s going on in your life is exactly as the Almighty had planned it. Your job is to trust the journey. You may not understand it. But let no one talk you out of it or discourage you. You don’t need a cheering squad to achieve your goals. Seek your strength from Him.
2391,2019-08-22 09:33:51+00:00,muftimenk,"With the Almighty, the impossible is possible. So keep supplicating because He will make sure that when the doors open, you’re certainly prepared to go through it. He knows when you’re ready; He will give it at the precise time. So don’t fret. Just keep asking!"
2392,2019-08-22 04:35:43+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re being tested, it’s important to keep your focus in the right direction. If you let Satan mess with your mind, you’re going to lose the plot and end up miserable. Remember, where you choose to focus is where your life will head. Keep the Almighty in sight always!"
2393,2019-08-21 19:13:03+00:00,muftimenk,"When you live with an attitude of gratitude, you’re protecting yourself from evil and all forms of negativity. You don’t feel discouraged because you have a grateful heart. Keep nurturing that feeling. Seek the Almighty always &amp; you’ll overcome the hardships in your life!"
2394,2019-08-21 07:48:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let this world make you bitter, hard &amp; cold-hearted. No matter how bad things are, don’t let whatever happens to you make you unkind &amp; unfeeling. It’s not okay to hurt or be mean to others. No matter how they treat you, choose to be the better person. Rise above it all!"
2395,2019-08-21 02:12:59+00:00,muftimenk,"We need to stop blaming others for the things that happen in our lives. Learn to take ownership of our problem, assess our strength &amp; weakness. Don’t focus solely on the wrongs as it can become demoralizing. But we need to recognize our faults. Correct them &amp; get back on track."
2396,2019-08-20 17:39:31+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what others say about you, no matter how hard they try to twist the truth, take heart knowing that the Almighty knows what’s in your heart. He knows your intent. He knows what the outcome will be. So don’t fret. Let people have their say. In the end, only He matters!"
2397,2019-08-20 10:55:23+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s in the nature of man to let others down. Don’t be upset when someone disappoints you, fails you &amp; shows you who they truly are. It’s to be expected. It happens to the best of us. It’s not within your control. Take it in your stride; move on, knowing you’ve done your best."
2398,2019-08-20 04:12:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Tomorrow is perhaps the most overrated word. Everyone wants to do something tomorrow; start praying tomorrow; change for the better tomorrow; get that piece of work done tomorrow. But you know what? Most of the time, it doesn’t happen! What if tomorrow never comes? Do it today!"
2399,2019-08-19 18:42:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Every pain has a purpose. Every fall has a reason. Else the Almighty wouldn’t have allowed it to happen. Remember, life is a process. Each part of it is necessary to reach your next milestone. Short cuts won’t work. So embrace whatever He has planned and you’ll rise again!"
2400,2019-08-19 11:51:20+00:00,muftimenk,"At some stage, you will feel  drained and overwhelmed by what’s going on around you. It can consume you and affect you negatively if you don’t do anything about it. Turn to the Almighty for strength and the will to carry on. Keep asking Him and He will see you through."
2401,2019-08-19 05:00:12+00:00,muftimenk,It’s easy to judge others. It only takes seconds to form your opinion. But it takes a lifetime to understand them and build them up. It’s easy to put people down when you’ve not walked in their shoes. Be kind. Be just. Be compassionate. Always empathise.
2402,2019-08-18 21:36:44+00:00,muftimenk,Don't be afraid of doing something because you're scared of what people are going to say about you. People will judge you no matter what. That’s just the way life is. Keep doing your thing and ignore the voices of dissent. You only have to please the Almighty and no one else.
2403,2019-08-18 15:09:53+00:00,muftimenk,"When you ask the Almighty for something, never ever think for a moment that He cannot give it to you. Have firm faith in Him that He will do what’s best. He can turn your most hopeless, impossible situations to reality. All you need is a sincere call and utmost patience!"
2404,2019-08-18 07:18:19+00:00,muftimenk,"We have become experts in diagnosing other people’s problems. We know everything about everyone, mainly because of social media. But we tend to pay little or no attention to ourselves. If we’d only focus on improving ourselves a bit more, the world would be a much better place!"
2405,2019-08-17 18:27:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Some think money is everything. It’s not. Your connection with the One who made you is more important than all the wealth in the world. Your wealth, status &amp; power should never make you feel arrogant. Remember, like a bolt from the blue, the Almighty can reclaim everything!"
2406,2019-08-17 09:15:48+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t dislike people just because you’ve heard something bad about them. Always give them the benefit of the doubt. Would you like others to do that to you? Surely you don’t want to be condemned by those you’ve not even met? Be fair. The Almighty loves those who are fair-minded
2407,2019-08-17 04:51:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste the good that you do. Ensure that they are solely for the sake of the Almighty. Because if you do them with ulterior motives, they’re wasted; they won’t last; the reward is only gained in this world &amp; does not extend to the next life. So keep purifying your intent!"
2408,2019-08-16 23:38:41+00:00,muftimenk,"If I don't respond to a crisis the way YOU want me to respond, it doesn't mean I'm not concerned. Perhaps I've responded in another more effective way. Learn to appreciate the diversity in our approach to issues. We do care &amp; we are concerned. May peace &amp; sanity prevail! Aameen"
2409,2019-08-16 18:41:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Blessed is he who's not attached to the worldly life, doesn't care much about people praising him &amp; never worries about the criticisms of others. He takes everything in his stride &amp; succumbs fully to the Decree of the Almighty. His heart’s content because he knows nothing lasts."
2410,2019-08-16 10:04:54+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel like you can't keep going, turn your heart to the One who knows about very aspect of your life. Tell Him you can’t carry on. But He can. Only He can turn things around for you. Ask Him to replace what's lost, mend what's broken and make you feel whole again!"
2411,2019-08-16 04:05:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, keep us safe from hypocrites &amp; those who have bad intention towards us. Surround us with good people; those who spread positivity &amp; constantly remind us of You. Guide us in all that we do; all the way to our ultimate destination, Paradise! Aameen."
2412,2019-08-15 16:41:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Parenting is not an easy task. But no matter what obstacles you face, keep going. Keep leading by example. Keep being a role model for your children. The good we teach our children stays with them &amp; will become a part of their daily lives. So plant good seeds in their hearts!"
2413,2019-08-15 08:33:53+00:00,muftimenk,Don't say you’re giving up because you’re tired of waiting. How could you? Have you forgotten the Almighty’s promise? He won’t burden you with that which you have no ability to bear. Trust Him. He’s in full control &amp; watching over you. Keep going; your breakthrough is in sight.
2414,2019-08-15 03:45:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Prayer
Almighty. I ask you to strengthen me so I can face whatever challenges You put in my path &amp; not be overwhelmed by them. I know You see my tears and hear my prayers. I also know that You’re testing me. Grant me the ability to endure &amp; face this with utmost patience. Aameen."
2415,2019-08-14 20:39:24+00:00,muftimenk,We’re only human &amp; we tend to feel down or upset at times. But don’t allow such feelings to interfere with how you communicate with others. It’s easy to lash out &amp; vent your anger but learn to control yourself. It’s one of the hardest things to do. But the rewards are great!
2416,2019-08-14 03:13:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Understand that disappointment is not a bad thing. When something we dislike happens, we think it’s a mistake. We get upset. We forget that the Almighty is in control. He sees things we don’t. The bigger picture will emerge soon and we will thank Him for His Infinite Wisdom!"
2417,2019-08-13 20:14:03+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have attained that special connection with the Almighty, nothing can disturb your peace. You fully submit to His Decree. He will hide your faults like clothing hides the blemishes on your skin. He will beautify you and only show your good side and endear you to others!"
2418,2019-08-13 02:51:28+00:00,muftimenk,"The problem with most is they engage in prayer only because they want the Almighty to do something for them. That’s wrong! Prayer is about connecting and communicating with Him. Once you’ve achieved this, His help and blessings will follow undoubtedly.  So establish that link!"
2419,2019-08-12 19:03:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people find it so hard to apologize when they’ve done wrong. It’s to do with their pride. You can never get them to say  sorry, no matter how obvious their mistake is. Beware such pride; for even the size of a mustard seed will not let you smell Paradise."

2422,2019-08-11 19:20:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful not to provoke people beyond their limits; like the one who doesn’t retaliate when you wrong him. Instead, he raises his hands to the heavens &amp; seeks help from the Almighty; the most powerful One. So be mindful not to hurt others. If you do, quickly seek forgiveness."
2423,2019-08-11 14:09:28+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to just look at what others have &amp; start comparing it with everything that’s wrong in your life. Don’t! Instead, ask the Almighty for a  fresh start in any area of your life. Let go of the old &amp; that which is bad for your inner peace. Start anew. Feel the heart lighten!"
2424,2019-08-11 08:35:52+00:00,muftimenk,The sacrifice on #EidAlAdha is to show gratitude to the Almighty for His blessings &amp; a means to feed the less fortunate. I wish you all a Blessed Eid-ul Adha. Eid of the Sacrifice of Prophet Abraham pbuh. #EidMubarak #barkadasallah #SelamatHariRayaKorban
2425,2019-08-11 00:36:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. We belong to You and to You is our return. Shower Your everlasting Mercy on us always, forgive us and guide us towards that which pleases You at all times. Help us to stay clear of that which displeases You. May You accept all our prayers and grant us ease. Aameen."
2426,2019-08-10 18:21:59+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty is All-Knowing. He pays attention. He’s aware who is talking about you behind your back, who is trying to bring you down. Why worry? You stand to gain a lot of good deeds on Judgement Day from those who have discredited you. Carry on doing your best in everything!"
2427,2019-08-10 12:38:12+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty made each &amp; everyone of us special. Don’t apologize for who you are. Work hard to be the best version of yourself. If someone is uncomfortable with you; that’s not your concern but theirs. Don’t change just to please others. We weren't meant to be liked by everyone.
2428,2019-08-10 04:29:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. As pilgrims gather in #Arafah on this Great Day of #Hajj, we pray that You grant them ease &amp; accept their acts of worship. Aameen."
2429,2019-08-09 18:11:41+00:00,muftimenk,"On this blessed day, may we have the ability to give up something for the sake of the Almighty. Do it sincerely for Him with full submission. It will strengthen our faith. May we achieve the benefits of these ten days &amp; may He accept the sincere efforts of those on #Hajj."
2430,2019-08-09 15:29:22+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste time engaging in sin. You have the chance to start anew every day when the Almighty returns your soul to you after sleep. It’s up to you to decide today how you want to live your life; in His pleasure or displeasure. You have a duty to fulfil. Make it a good one!
2431,2019-08-09 04:41:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, forgive us &amp; bless us with your endless Mercy. Enrich us with the goodness of these days of Hajj. Grant us our prayers &amp; forgive our shortcomings. Pardon those who have gone before us. Teach us to always care for one another &amp; protect us from evil."
2432,2019-08-08 22:28:54+00:00,muftimenk,Trust when you don’t have the answers. Trust when you can’t find the way out. Trust when you don’t know what’s happening. Trust when it defies your logic. Trust when everyone tells you it won’t work. This is what faith is all about. Trust the Almighty. Fully. Without a doubt!
2433,2019-08-08 17:17:01+00:00,muftimenk,"What is this life but a number of days. Remember, with each passing day, a part of us passes away, as we get closer to our final destination. So do good &amp; be the best you can be. That’s how you’ll be remembered."
2434,2019-08-08 09:27:20+00:00,muftimenk,"You can have all the love in this world, but if your heart is devoid of the love of your Maker, you’ll be the poorest person. The truth is you’ll never be at ease. Satan will fill the void with all things fleeting &amp; you’ll end up miserable. Turn to Him for that inner peace."
2435,2019-08-07 19:37:44+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Safeguard those who have gathered for the #Hajj in the Holy Lands. Grant them ease &amp; accept their sacrifice in Your Name. Allow them to return to their loved ones having gained the ultimate reward. Aameen
2436,2019-08-07 10:27:25+00:00,muftimenk,"When we judge by our own standards of appearance, we fail to acknowledge the Almighty’s focus on the state of our hearts. The trouble is today, many think physical appearance is the most important because that is what man sees! Our hearts are tainted. Don’t fall into this trap."
2437,2019-08-07 04:48:03+00:00,muftimenk,"We all know difficult people in our lives. Those who are manipulative &amp; toxic; who will anger &amp; irritate us. Dealing with them can be difficult. Do your best; minimise contact. Often, they’re not people of logic but of emotion, prejudice &amp; pride. Let the Almighty handle them."
2438,2019-08-06 20:11:23+00:00,muftimenk,Satan always wants to make you feel depressed and defeated. Quit feeling that way. Pick yourself up. Turn to the Almighty and walk in His Path.
2439,2019-08-06 13:23:44+00:00,muftimenk,Your life isn’t just about you. The Almighty created you for a purpose. Use whatever He has blessed you with to impact the world &amp; those around you. Don’t be selfish. Help as much as you can. Spread goodness &amp; kindness. We have a limited time on earth. Use it productively!
2440,2019-08-06 06:43:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Humility is everything. 
No matter how successful, how good looking, how rich or how smart you are remember, nobody likes arrogance. Stay connected to people. Stay real. That’s the hallmark of true success!"
2441,2019-08-05 19:46:30+00:00,muftimenk,"When you want to give advice, do so in such a way that people would want to listen to you. Don’t be mean and hurtful. Don’t use harsh words. Don’t put people down. Be genuine and nurturing in wanting to correct them, mend their ways and help them get back on track."
2442,2019-08-05 14:04:01+00:00,muftimenk,"There are people who won’t hesitate to provoke you, trying their best to bring out the worst in you. When they’ve achieved that, they’ll play the victim and make you feel bad. Be mindful of such people. They really need help. Try your best to remain calm. Keep your composure!"
2443,2019-08-05 05:37:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Heartaches &amp; pain are real. Don’t take them lightly. Unfortunately most would seek other people in trying to find comfort. The truth is the only One who can heal you is the Almighty. Ask for strength, comfort, healing, &amp; perseverance. He will show you all that &amp; more. Trust Him"
2444,2019-08-04 15:50:34+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how negative you may feel, always try and communicate in as positive a manner as possible. If you choose words that are negative, that’s the impression you will leave with the person on the receiving end. So don’t respond when you’re angry or when others annoy you!"

2446,2019-08-04 09:23:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Your mind can be your worst enemy. Train it well. Don’t dwell on negativity. Don’t let Satan take control and corrupt it. Always ask the Almighty to help you submit to His Decree. When you’re able to achieve that, you’ll reach a state of calmness and serenity! You’re content!"
2447,2019-08-03 21:10:08+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let your pain make you unkind. Nobody knows what the other person is going through. There is too much suffering in the world already.
2448,2019-08-03 13:41:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose your friends wisely. It’s always easier to pull people down than to build them up. Make sure your circle of friends will do just that; moving you in the right direction. They should be building you up rather than tearing you down. If you have such friends, treasure them!"
2449,2019-08-03 06:50:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep asking the Almighty to redirect our thoughts so that we focus on those things that are good and pure, honorable and righteous, excellent and worthy of praise. Banish thoughts that cloud your judgement, cause doubt and make you think ill of others! They’re the work of Satan."
2450,2019-08-02 21:03:05+00:00,muftimenk,Take advantage of these blessed days. Keep asking the Almighty for anything &amp; everything. He loves it when you ask. Ask for forgiveness for all your sins. Thank Him for all the Blessings &amp; Bounties. Ask with humility &amp; humbleness. Never demand. May He grant us what we ask for.
2451,2019-08-02 12:42:00+00:00,muftimenk,"You can attain true peace when you finally realize that everything happens for a reason; by the will of the Almighty. He is the One in total control. You can bear any hardship with patience if you learn to trust Him. Don’t be sad or weakened by it. Relax, He’s got your back!"
2452,2019-08-02 04:36:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray for ease &amp; comfort. The world seems to be spinning out of control. There’s chaos everywhere; even in our own lives.There are days when we feel like giving up. Yet we know that’s not an option. You’re the only One who has all the answers!"
2453,2019-08-01 22:53:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Take charge of your life. Focus on the positives &amp; don’t dwell on the negatives. Satan will steer you towards worldly matters, cloud your mind &amp; take you away from the Almighty. Stay firmly rooted to your faith. Stay vigilant. Embrace your own strength &amp; know your self-worth."
2454,2019-08-01 14:45:52+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re feeling that life is unfair &amp; people are treating you badly, remember, the Almighty knows the truth. Let people think what they will; you can’t control them. But the Lord of the Worlds is always in full control. Do your best &amp; let Him fight the rest of your battles!"
2455,2019-08-01 04:37:23+00:00,muftimenk,We’ve all had those days when we don’t want to get out of bed &amp; face the world. That’s when you need to trust the Almighty even more. Build a strong bond with Him. An unshakeable faith that applies to all aspects of your life. It will see you through in this life &amp; the Hereafter!
2456,2019-07-31 16:18:27+00:00,muftimenk,"We’re careful what we put into our mouths, choosing our foods meticulously so that they keep our bodies functioning well. The same should apply to what comes out of our mouths. If we choose to spew hateful, curse &amp; swear words, imagine how that would impact the ones affected."
2457,2019-07-31 05:56:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Worrying about what happened yesterday won’t change anything. Learn from it. Move on. Worrying about tomorrow is also futile because we don’t know what it holds. Take it one step at a time, one day at a time. Trust His Plans &amp; don’t let worry rob you of life’s precious moments!"
2458,2019-07-30 20:55:52+00:00,muftimenk,Congratulations to my brother Dr Isa Ali Pantami @DrIsaPantami upon being confirmed as Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. May the Almighty guide you to the best and most productive decisions always. Aameen #MaashaaAllah #Tabarakallah #Nigeria #Pantami
2459,2019-07-30 19:47:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Jealousy is toxic to the soul. It can ruin you from the inside out. You can remove it by loving yourself &amp; who you are. You need to accept, be grateful &amp; be satisfied with what the Almighty has chosen for you. He has given you so much.  Don’t look at the blessings of others!"
2460,2019-07-30 11:19:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Being happy &amp; being content are two different things. Happiness is fleeting, it comes &amp; goes, comes mainly form the outside. Contentment comes from a deeper place. You’re at peace with what the Almighty has bestowed on you, no matter what your circumstances. You trust Him fully!"
2461,2019-07-29 21:48:05+00:00,muftimenk,"You become what you constantly think about. If you think you can’t, you probably won’t make it. If you think you’re a failure, you’ll end up not doing anything significant in life. If you think negative thoughts always, you’ll end up with negative results. Guard your thoughts!"
2462,2019-07-29 08:30:14+00:00,muftimenk,"As humans, we tend to compare. Don’t think of others who seem to  have a better life. The trouble is we see perfect images everywhere today. We wonder why we don’t have the same. Don’t fall into that trap. Thank the Almighty for all that you’ve been blessed with."
2463,2019-07-29 04:05:59+00:00,muftimenk,Your time is the most valuable gift you can give to your family.  Money comes &amp; goes but the memories will stay far beyond all that. The strong bond you develop will last a long while. Start giving the gift of time before it’s too late. Don’t put it off because life’s too short!
2464,2019-07-28 21:53:42+00:00,muftimenk,"""Respect Life! It was given by He who gave you your own life!""

I'm truly saddened by the senseless killings across the globe almost every day. The latest being in #Nigeria where mourners were gunned down this evening. Absolutely unacceptable. Almighty! Grant us peace &amp; sanity."
2465,2019-07-28 16:10:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Always ask the Almighty to soften our hearts. May we have compassion for those who suffer in unimaginable ways. Learn to pray passionately for them as we do for ourselves &amp; our loved ones. And above all, may our souls remain humble at all times!"
2466,2019-07-28 04:39:52+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t feel that you have to tell everyone what you’ve been up to in your life. You don’t! Nobody needs to know everything. Don’t announce it on social media too because having people with eyes that constantly pry into your private life is not healthy. It attracts envy &amp; hatred.
2467,2019-07-27 20:38:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Why are you being tested again  &amp; again; one hardship after another while others have it so easy? Until you’re broken, you don't truly know your inner strength. Embrace what happens &amp; use it to build yourself all over again, but this time, stronger than ever! The Almighty knows!"
2468,2019-07-27 05:28:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Misunderstanding often leads to grudges. When we hold a grudge, we give someone power over our emotions. Without forgiveness, it’s easy to let things get out of hand. When we forgive, our doors and avenues to goodness open up. It puts our relationship with Him back on track!"
2469,2019-07-26 22:52:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to quieten the negative voices in your head. If you start entertaining them, they willl get louder &amp; demand more attention. It’s all part of Satan’s plan to get you down in the dumps. Don’t give in. Put up a barrier of positivity around you &amp; see how your life shapes up."
2470,2019-07-26 12:23:44+00:00,muftimenk,Be wary of toxic people around you. Those who come in to lower your self-esteem. Those who come into your life &amp; leave you worse off than you were before. They will hinder your growth &amp; cause you misery. Learn to spot them. Don’t get involved with them. Say a prayer for them.
2471,2019-07-26 02:58:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, grant us peace of mind and relieve the anxiety and stress we experience in our daily lives. Give us clarity of mind to do what’s best. Guide us through this path of life which is often paved with many obstacles. Let peace reign in our hearts!"
2472,2019-07-25 21:09:22+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with us is we hate waiting. We want everything to happen on our terms. We think of waiting as negative; we get impatient when nothing is happening. Remember, the Almighty is watching how we behave while waiting. How we get to the destination is just as important."
2473,2019-07-25 06:12:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything happens for a reason. You’ve got to believe that. You’ve got to trust the Almighty’s plan for you even if you don’t understand it. Whatever’s going on in your life, the journey continues. Nothing comes to a standstill. Have faith that it will all work out in the end!"
2474,2019-07-24 12:59:34+00:00,muftimenk,There will always be critics. Some will be constructive while others just want to tear you down. Don’t waste your time trying to convince the wrong people; just keep running your race and do what you do best. Focus on the positives and don’t feel the need to engage them!
2475,2019-07-24 05:09:46+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t curse the hardship you’re facing. Every trial has a silver lining; a blessing in disguise. Learn to bear good patience. Let the situation unfold. Do your best and let the Almighty do the rest. You’ll emerge stronger and better prepared to face whatever He sends your way.
2476,2019-07-23 18:56:38+00:00,muftimenk,Know when to get involved and when to lay off. Some things just aren’t worth your energy. There’s too much going on around us and it’s easy to get sucked into other people’s drama. Learn to take a step back &amp; look at things in perspective. Don’t be too quick to take the plunge.
2477,2019-07-23 10:59:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Being betrayed is hard to live with. The sorrow of betrayal doesn't come all at once but in stages, as you begin to realise the extent. Once trust is violated, old emotions &amp; pain are always at the back of your mind. So don’t betray trust for it’ll be hard to restore what’s lost!"
2478,2019-07-22 23:46:11+00:00,muftimenk,Be careful what you say to others because you may not get a chance to take back your words. You may say things you don’t mean at the height of anger &amp; live to regret it. It is so easy to get worked up on a daily basis. Don’t. It’s not worth it!
2479,2019-07-22 12:11:03+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s a purpose for the pain you’ve endured; the tears, the lonely nights. They brought you back to the One who made you. The One who showed you the path of light &amp; lightened the heaviness in your heart, who made you get rid of your ego &amp; turn to Him for help. Trust Him always!"
2480,2019-07-21 22:40:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to listen with your heart. Before long you’ll be able to understand the Almighty’s Plan for you. Focus on the positive, the good that’s happening, the blessings He’s bestowed on you &amp; soon you’ll be living a life of gratitude &amp; praise. It will change your outlook forever!"
2481,2019-07-21 13:33:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let success go to your head. Be the first to apologize for your mistakes. You’ll never learn anything or impress anyone by making excuses &amp;  shifting the blame. Treat everyone with dignity &amp; respect. You may be successful, but that doesn’t make you better than anyone else!"
2482,2019-07-20 17:50:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Admit your mistakes. It’s a good trait to have and it gains respect from the ones around you because it shows both humility and your willingness to learn. Remember, it’s easy to claim responsibility when things go well, but it’s hard when they don’t. Don’t look for scapegoats!"
2483,2019-07-20 10:54:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t think that you can make yourself happy by bringing misery to other people. You can’t. It doesn’t work that way. The Almighty is fully aware and knows what’s going on. If you want happiness, make others happy and you’ll feel the ripple effect of that happiness as well!"
2484,2019-07-19 23:15:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Be extremely careful when making assumptions about others. When you lack complete information, you have to fill in the blanks yourself; based on what you may have heard from others. You connect the dots and as a result you’re most likely to jump to the wrong conclusion!"
2485,2019-07-19 09:01:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t hate yourself for the mistakes you make in life. They are turning points. They are important lessons you need to learn. Remember, none of it is random. The Almighty designs them for a reason. They are meant to make you a better person. Correct yourself and move on!"
2486,2019-07-19 00:28:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, accept the deeds that we do solely for Your Sake. We are trying our best. We’re not perfect and often we falter, we sin, we make mistakes. Forgive us. We will never lose hope in Your Mercy and will always keep our hearts attached to You! Aameen!"
2487,2019-07-18 15:57:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Believe that the Almighty will protect you at all costs. As long as you have Him in your life, you’ll achieve success. If it’s good for you, He’ll make sure that you succeed. If it’s bad for you, He will take it away from you,whether you like it or not. His job is to protect you."
2488,2019-07-18 09:31:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Laziness &amp; putting things off are all part of the Devil’s plan. If you keep procrastinating, before you know it, years have gone by. But what’s worse is you may not live to do it as no one is promised tomorrow. You’ll never know when all this will end. Don’t delay. Act on it now!"
2489,2019-07-18 02:37:17+00:00,muftimenk,"In this day and age, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to see what’s wrong and what’s right. The lines are getting blurred. What’s right is being made to look wrong and the reverse is true. Be mindful. Don’t fall into this trap. Hold on to what the Almighty has prescribed."
2490,2019-07-17 20:33:59+00:00,muftimenk,We need to realize that our  constant need to complain has a simple and fundamental reason: we lack of a sense of contentment. The truth is we are often dissatisfied &amp; it has taken the place of contentment in our hearts. So everything that we say is a reflection of how we feel!
2491,2019-07-17 13:31:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people get threatened when others shine their light on the rest of the world. They think if you shine bright, it somehow dims theirs &amp; gives them less opportunity to find their own success. Remember, the Almighty has given us all a chance to be successful. Everyone of us."
2492,2019-07-17 08:41:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is fragile. Today you’re here, tomorrow you’re gone. So don’t stress too much about your worldly affairs. Take it in your stride. You’ll be spending forever in the Hereafter. Build your resources (deeds) to secure a better life. Satan will distract you, so remain vigilant!"
2493,2019-07-16 22:24:46+00:00,muftimenk,We are all scarred in one way or another. The scars you get in life are proof of your inner strength. It shows how you lived your life! They are there to strengthen you; to remind you that these are among the Almighty’s biggest tests &amp; how you survived with beautiful patience!
2494,2019-07-16 15:40:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t allow family members to trample over your wife. Remember, she gave up everything to be with you. She’s not an unpaid housekeeper to be used at their whim and fancy. Be fearful of her supplication to the Almighty. He’s watching and will surely come to her rescue eventually!"
2495,2019-07-16 05:48:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry when things don’t work out. If you’ve tried your best &amp; it doesn’t work then let it go. Free yourself from worries &amp; pain by relying only on the Almighty. Just be patient, your time is yet to come. The Almighty knows your struggles. He hears your prayers!"
2496,2019-07-15 23:13:33+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has made us all unique, with different atttibutes and talents. But always be humble enough to know that you’re no better than the person next to you. He has a plan for each and everyone of us. Use your talent wisely. Spread goodness and kindness wherever you go!"
2497,2019-07-15 11:50:35+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s natural to be disappointed when people let you down. It’s the Almighty’s way of showing you their true colours in your hour of need; to show you who they really are. It’s a reminder to depend only on Him. If you do otherwise, be prepared for disappointment."
2498,2019-07-14 23:27:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t engage friends who speak ill of their spouses to you. No matter how close you are to them, learn to keep friendship separate from their personal life. You have to draw the line. The erring spouses could have repented &amp; changed their ways &amp; you’re still bad mouthing them."

Well done #England

2500,2019-07-14 15:21:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes change means starting over. Don’t be afraid to do that. At times, you need to overhaul your life to see your steps ahead. So whatever you’re experiencing, don’t be afraid to start over. This time, you’re not starting from scratch but you’re starting from experience!"
2501,2019-07-14 06:46:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you sometimes feel like things have become too difficult and there’s nothing good left for your future. That is what Satan wants you to believe, like there’s no way out. He wants us to believe that we’re all alone but we’re NOT! The Almighty says never lose hope in His Mercy."
2502,2019-07-14 00:24:41+00:00,muftimenk,Be wary of arrogance. It comes in many shades &amp; forms. There are some who feel they’re all powerful. They attribute their achievements to their own efforts solely. They neglect the Almighty in the whole equation. It’s all about them. Darkness &amp; disbelief will cover their hearts
2503,2019-07-13 07:21:35+00:00,muftimenk,"This world is such that there’ll be people who love you and those who will hate you. Remember, you’re not for everyone and that’s ok. You’re not in this world to win a popularity poll. So don’t waste your time with such people. Share your journey with those who value you."
2504,2019-07-12 14:59:15+00:00,muftimenk,What have we become today? We hardly speak to people anymore. Even phone calls are being replaced by WhatsApp. We hide our feelings and turn them into tweets and blogposts. Our memories are merely a collection of photos on Instagram. Let us strive not to lose the human touch!
2505,2019-07-12 04:44:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to protect our families &amp; loved ones for we often take them for granted. Help us realise how fortunate we are to have a family unit who is a source of support, love &amp; encouragement. It’s a blessing often overlooked. Keep them safe always."
2506,2019-07-11 19:53:17+00:00,muftimenk,Don't worry about the pain. It will heal. Just remember the lesson learnt. You will get over it but you won't forget. That's the beauty of time &amp; patience. The lessons become valuable life experience which the Almighty wants us to embrace. He will try us again &amp; again till we do!
2507,2019-07-11 12:59:25+00:00,muftimenk,"It hurts badly now and you’re on the verge of giving up. You’re wondering if the Almighty is aware of what you’re going through. Never doubt that He’s All-Knowing, All-Seeing. Remember, you might be going through a lot of pain but it doesn’t mean the result won’t be beautiful!"
2508,2019-07-11 05:18:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people won’t hesitate to use you to serve their purpose. Whatever you do, don’t get involved in their drama if they try to make you take sides. There’s always two sides to a story. Be fair, stay positive &amp; don’t pit one against the other. Let them resolve their differences!"
2509,2019-07-10 20:46:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Confide in the Almighty always. When you shed tears in front of others, you have to explain yourself. When you cry your heart out to Him, you don’t need to say a word. He knows what’s in your heart even before your lips utter them. No one can love you or understand you better!"
2510,2019-07-10 15:00:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Social media has given a voice to the voiceless. Our videos, posts &amp; comments online are a reflection of who we are &amp; what we stand for. Unfortunately, people with ill intent use them to spew hate &amp; spread ignorance. Don't let their comments affect you. Such people need help!"
2511,2019-07-10 02:23:28+00:00,muftimenk,"No one can teach you better than the life lessons the Almighty sends your way. Experience is one of the best teachers. So embrace the pain, the endurance &amp; all that comes with the lesson. You’re never too old to learn &amp; it’s never too late. Seek His help &amp; guidance always."
2512,2019-07-09 12:54:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the negativity that keeps popping up in your mind. At times, this is related to a setback you’ve had. You need to counter it &amp; don’t worry what people may think. They’ll talk anyway. You can’t stop them. What you can do is to focus on the positive &amp; goodness around you!"
2513,2019-07-09 04:17:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Taking your own life is NOT an option! When you feel like you can’t do it anymore, remember, to prolong your prayer and confide in Him. Make the Almighty your Friend; such that even if you lose the connections of this world, it doesn’t matter. Your connection with Him is intact."
2514,2019-07-08 17:24:31+00:00,muftimenk,"No one said life was easy. The twists and turns, the roadblocks; they’re all part of the journey. When you don’t understand what’s going on in your life, just take a deep breath and say a prayer. Almighty, this is Your Plan. Your Wisdom and Guidance will see me through it."
2515,2019-07-08 07:52:40+00:00,muftimenk,"The reason many people are on social media is because they want attention. It’s measured by the number of likes, views, retweets, comments etc. Remember, you don't have to rely on others for your confidence and self-esteem. Disengage from seeking attention. Love yourself first!"
2516,2019-07-07 16:06:51+00:00,muftimenk,"When life gets hard it’s easy to think of the worst &amp; stop dreaming of good things because it feels like they are unachievable. You’ll get days when you want to quit. But firm faith &amp; the belief that after hardship, there’ll be ease, should see you through your journey!"
2517,2019-07-07 04:07:21+00:00,muftimenk,"You want to move forward but you keep thinking about your sins &amp; feel hopeless. Don’t! It’s easier said than done. It’s Satan’s handiwork, messing up your mind. You deserve His Mercy. Never lose hope. The Almighty will forgive as long as you’re turning to Him! Seek Him sincerely!"
2518,2019-07-06 14:01:27+00:00,muftimenk,"More are suffering from diseases of the heart because of social media. Jealousy, unhappiness, feelings of inadequacy take root when the difference between real or fake vanishes. Sadly, a lot of what we see is fake. Don’t fall for it. Flaws &amp; imperfections make us human!"
2519,2019-07-06 05:56:39+00:00,muftimenk,"We shouldn’t be defined by others' viewpoint of us, but rather by our actions and our own words. The words we choose to describe people can have a huge impact on them. We never know what each one is experiencing. Let people live their own lives. Let us not judge and label."
2520,2019-07-05 20:51:31+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is many of us spend a lot of time inside our own mind, overthinking, worrying about what’s to come, regretting past events &amp; generally complaining about life. These cause stress &amp; sap your energy. Train your mind to think positive. You’ll lead a more content life!"
2521,2019-07-05 12:21:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Be the one who earns the love of the Almighty and eventually His Paradise by controlling your anger. Don’t let it control you. It’s one of the most noble acts to do. Instead of responding in rapid-fire manner, stay calm and collected, knowing that He is watching your reaction!"
2522,2019-07-05 03:28:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, may You shine Your light on us during our darkest hours and relieve our fears &amp; anxieties. Guide us in our journey to healing &amp; recovery. Grant us patience and wisdom that we so badly need. Remind us constantly that we never have to walk alone!"
2523,2019-07-04 20:32:18+00:00,muftimenk,"On your darkest days, remind yourself how far you’ve come already. You have a lot to be thankful for and every reason to not stop but keep moving forward. Keep telling yourself you can do this because the Lord of the Worlds can make things happen anytime! Your turn will come."

No matter how badly it hurts now, one day you’ll look back and realize that it changed your life for the better. So endure and you’ll emerge the better for it!"
2527,2019-07-04 05:34:20+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let doubt &amp; whisperings of Satan take centrestage in your mind. Shake off whatever is trying to hold you back from all that the Almighty has decreed for you. Don’t entertain such thoughts. You’re a person of courage. Go forth &amp; accomplish what you need to. He’s with you.
2528,2019-07-03 13:13:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Love, trust and mutual respect are the bedrock of a solid marriage. It doesn’t come easy. It’s hard work &amp; has to be nurtured daily. Don’t let mistrust creep into the equation. Don’t give your spouse reason to mistrust you. Once trust is broken, it will not be the same again."
2529,2019-07-03 04:05:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Through the toughest times, ponder over &amp; appreciate the countless favours of the Almighty upon us. We mostly don't realise the true value of things or people until we lose them. Don't be sad simply because a few things are not going your way. Focus on the positives &amp; thank Him."
2530,2019-07-02 19:16:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Why can’t we be happy for others when they achieve something? As in truly happy; no snide remarks or sarcastic comments. It all stems from the heart. The positive energy you exude towards others will come back to you. So the next time, you hear such news, celebrate, don’t hate!"
2531,2019-07-02 07:14:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about what people might say. You can’t stop them from talking, that’s the reality. What others think won’t stop the Almighty from doing what He needs to in your life. So don’t ever let the opinions of others hold you back! He has given you the capabilities. Use them!"
2532,2019-07-01 17:12:21+00:00,muftimenk,You may have fulfilled the rights of your spouse but it doesn’t give you the green light to treat him or her badly. Be worried of the supplication of the spouse you have mistreated. The Almighty is All-Seeing. He can turn the tide against you. Be mindful of your actions!
2533,2019-07-01 07:51:26+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what life dishes out, stand up, dust yourself &amp; keep going. Easier said than done? The truth is you’ve no other choice. Of course you can stay down &amp; let it get worse. Satan will mess with your mind so much that you think you’re doomed! Never lose hope in His Mercy!"
2534,2019-07-01 00:13:06+00:00,muftimenk,"The company you keep says a lot about you. Friends have a big influence over how you feel, think &amp; behave. Beware the ones who will mould you to become like them. Some will control you till you mimic their behaviour. If you’re weak-willed, chances are you’ll succumb &amp; cave in!"
2535,2019-06-30 17:25:00+00:00,muftimenk,"If your intent is wrong, your deeds done for the sake of humankind will come to nought. Check your intentions often. Because you don’t want to fall into the trap; you think you’re doing a lot but when you arrive on Judgement Day, you’re a bankrupt! That would be devastating!"
2536,2019-06-30 05:56:48+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in such an impatient world. Everything has to be quick, instantaneous, fast, in a hurry, this very minute! Sadly, we also expect the same from the Almighty when we ask Him to fulfil our wishes. We forget that He has His own timing. So wait patiently! That’s the test!"
2537,2019-06-29 23:12:26+00:00,muftimenk,Beware the uncontrolled ego; it will self-obsess you until you can’t stop thinking about yourself! You’re preoccupied with your own life &amp; circumstances; sparing little or no thought about others.  It can be destructive &amp; the consequences are normally dire. Drop the ego!
2538,2019-06-29 16:28:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep negativity out of your life at all costs. Don’t focus on the negatives, not just today but every day because it will only eat at your soul, slowly but surely. You’ll become a thankless person, always nitpicking over tiny details. Keep reminding yourself of the blessings!"
2539,2019-06-29 06:26:07+00:00,muftimenk,"It is easy to get distracted by dissenting voices and naysayers. Even if it’s one. But don’t let it affect you. Don’t let it influence you. Think of the majority who appreciate what you do. That should keep you going. Besides, your reward is with the Almighty. Not humankind."
2540,2019-06-28 18:43:49+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in angry times. All the sharing on social media makes it worse. Learn to control your innermost urge to retaliate. You don’t have to give as good as you got! If you don't slow down when you start to see red, you can do significant damage to your life. Keep the peace!"
2541,2019-06-28 05:42:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, save us from trials and heal the wounds we have collected and kept inside for too long. Grant us success we’ve never even had the audacity to believe possible. Don’t let our achievements get to our heads. Show us a way out of our difficulties."
2542,2019-06-27 22:34:27+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to stay away from arguments and other people’s drama. They sap your energy and rob your peace of mind. It takes a mature person to not get into an argument. Stay in your lane and watch from the sidelines if you must but don’t get involved. Maintain your calmness.
2543,2019-06-27 14:15:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing is ever taken away except that something equal or better will come your way. So whatever you think is falling apart is actually being rearranged by the Almighty to give you what you ultimately want. Ultimately; not today, not even this week or a month but for a lifetime!"
2544,2019-06-27 03:24:35+00:00,muftimenk,"People fail often because they put their trust, hope and confidence in their own ability or in other people. They forget who their Sustainer, Provider and Nourisher is! Put your trust in the Almighty. Seek Him. Depend on Him not on His creation who will often let you down!"
2545,2019-06-26 15:18:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Not every battle is worth fighting. Learn to be more discerning. Don’t get involved in other people’s drama. Sometimes it’s better to maintain the peace than to go all out to prove who is right. People might get hurt in the process. Leave it to the Almighty, the fairest Judge."
2546,2019-06-26 08:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty is the Turner of Hearts. He can change things in the blink of an eye. Don’t forget that. He can heal what has been hurting for years in a flash. He can forgive as He wills. Nothing is beyond the Lord of the Worlds. Have faith that things will work out in the end.
2547,2019-06-25 18:33:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When you forgive others for the sake of the Almighty, the rewards that come back to you will be far greater than anything you’ve lost  due to someone having wronged you or hurt you. Remember, your success is with Him, not His creation! Don’t worry about what people think!"
2548,2019-06-25 05:32:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fret if your efforts don’t receive any recognition or publicity. Know that the Almighty is protecting your sincerity and work from corruption. Most importantly, remember, He loves those deeds that are small and consistent. They have the most benefit in the long run."
2549,2019-06-24 20:50:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Publicizing a sin is so much more serious than the sin itself because it carries with it a level of arrogance &amp; promotion of illicit behavior. Instead of remorse over committing the sin, we are more caught up in trying to figure out how to show off what we did to our friends!"
2550,2019-06-24 03:47:18+00:00,muftimenk,There are some who love to create discord among people. They plant seeds of doubt in people’s minds about anyone they dislike. They go out of their way to tarnish people’s image with falsehoods. Be careful. You may think you’ll get away with it. You won’t! The Almighty knows!
2551,2019-06-23 19:49:47+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be disheartened if you can’t help much with charity in terms of material stuff. You can always be the one who adds value to the lives of others. Find ways to be a source of encouragement everywhere you go. Spread goodness and kindness always. It will all come back to you.
2552,2019-06-23 04:41:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Who lifted you when you were discouraged? Who found a way out for you when you thought it was a dead end? Who provided for you when you didn’t think you could make it through the day? Remember, the Almighty has brought you this far. He will keep you going! Trust!"
2553,2019-06-22 20:19:50+00:00,muftimenk,"When we hear bad about others, we're so quick to believe it. But when we hear good about them, we find it hard to believe. It shouldn't be so for a true believer. Don't believe the bad about others until it’s proven beyond any doubt &amp; if it doesn't concern you, stay out of it."
2554,2019-06-22 11:34:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the hypocrite. He’s always looking for faults or advising you about your life, job, habits, etc. But he never follows his own advice. Some have an agenda &amp; can hurt your self-confidence badly. Don’t give your time to deceitful people, pretending to be what they’re not!"
2555,2019-06-22 05:05:57+00:00,muftimenk,"In the eyes of man, a single bad deed can wipe out all the good you've done. But to the Almighty, a single good deed can wipe out all the bad you've done. He’s the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful! Focus on pleasing Him for you can never please others, no matter how hard you try!"
2556,2019-06-21 14:01:53+00:00,muftimenk,"At times when you’re facing your toughest battle, you might feel like you don’t belong anywhere. Banish that thought. It’s the work of Satan. You belong to the Almighty. He made you. He won’t abandon you. Remember His Promise. After hardship, comes ease. Be at peace."
2557,2019-06-21 05:13:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we beg You to help everyone who’s going through hardship in life; the broken, the downtrodden, the oppressed. May You remove all harm, change their situation &amp; guide them out of difficulty. May we all be completely dependent on You and You alone!"
2558,2019-06-20 20:10:53+00:00,muftimenk,"A good rule to live by; if you stop fueling a fire, it will burn itself out. If you stop fueling an argument with harsh words, it will stop eventually. But if you choose to engage with hurtful words it will get worse. The choice is yours. Learn to keep the peace as best you can."
2559,2019-06-20 08:29:55+00:00,muftimenk,"What goes around comes around. Whatever you give, comes back to you. What you sow, you reap. Give kindness, compassion, joy, encouragement, motivation and it will find its way back to you somehow, someday. Do you get the drift? So why would anyone want to spread negativity?"
2560,2019-06-19 19:33:36+00:00,muftimenk,"One of the most precious gifts we have is time. If we only knew how much time we had left in this world, we wouldn’t get distracted and lose focus, wasting our energy and attention on useless, pointless, meaningless things. Wake up before it’s too late!"
2561,2019-06-19 06:27:01+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as you want to change a person, be it your loved one, a friend or anyone for that matter, you can’t. Guidance comes from the Almighty. You can advise, show them the way, speak to them repeatedly. Beyond that, keep praying for them and leave the rest to the Almighty."
2562,2019-06-18 17:02:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When you don’t understand the Almighty’s Plan, you’re more likely to lose hope &amp; feel despondent. You think you’re doing everything wrong &amp; you’re unsure about what lies ahead. But don’t give up. Keep asking Him. He’s All-Knowing. He will steer you in the right direction!"
2563,2019-06-18 08:47:30+00:00,muftimenk,"If you only knew how fast people forget about those who have passed on, you won’t live to impress others. It’s one of the silliest things to do. Remember, you don’t need someone else’s validation. Live to impress the One who made you. The Almighty will never let you down!"
2564,2019-06-17 14:33:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything happens for a reason. The Almighty does not miscalculate anything. He knows the circumstances you’re facing. You’ll never be made to face a situation you can’t handle. So no matter what comes against you, with strong faith, it will never be too much for you to bear."
2565,2019-06-17 03:00:11+00:00,muftimenk,"You can’t fool all the people all the time. It won’t work; the truth will eventually out. Fear the Almighty in your dealings with others &amp; if you think you can get away with cheating &amp; abusing people’s trust, you’re wrong. It will come back to haunt you in the least expected way"
2566,2019-06-16 18:59:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Life can be overwhelming at times. Undoubtedly, you can feel lost in the journey but the Almighty knows exactly where you are &amp; what lies ahead in the quest to your destination. He knows how to get you to where you need to be. Trust Him &amp; walk in faith, knowing He will guide you!"
2567,2019-06-16 01:55:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Drawing inspiration from another person is allowed. But there are dangers of looking to so-called celebrities as role models. Remember, they’re just people. It's easy to forget this when society elevates them to superhuman status. They’re not. They make mistakes like all of us!"
2568,2019-06-15 11:51:16+00:00,muftimenk,Protect your tongue from slander. It’s one of the most hated crimes and the Almighty has promised severe punishment to the slanderer. Engaging in this sinful act will destroy your good deeds and devalue your worship and prayers. It will also exclude you from His protection.
2569,2019-06-15 02:20:41+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t take your sins lightly. You may think you’ve done nothing wrong but you forgot how you shouted at the housekeeper when you lost your temper;  the other person you pushed aside so you got ahead in the queue. May the Almighty help us to constantly reflect on our shortcomings.
2570,2019-06-14 17:45:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Your faith, like most things in life will fluctuate. Don’t expect it to remain constant. There’ll be ups and downs, highs and lows, good days and bad days. Don’t let that define you. Do things sincerely for the sake of the Almighty and your faith will strengthen by His Mercy."
2571,2019-06-13 23:18:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, grant us good patience in hard times. Let us learn to be grateful by recognizing that our trials could be much worse. Let us trust Your Plan and have complete reliance on You. Help us to remain close to You during both good and bad times. Aameen."
2572,2019-06-13 07:30:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Gossip is like something you’re craving for. You say you don’t like it, but when someone tells you a juicy piece of news, you can’t resist it. This is the work of Satan. Be wary when you develop an interest &amp; suddenly want to know what you don’t know about someone else."
2573,2019-06-12 21:44:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror. See if the person staring back at you is the person you want to be. Do this often as it is a good form of self-reflection. There’s always room for improvement. Focus on trying to be a better person today than you were yesterday."
2574,2019-06-12 09:00:55+00:00,muftimenk,"For many, their darkest days are normally the ones that draw them closest to the Almighty. Their most profound experience of worship will be when they’re on the brink of giving up; when they feel there are no options. Let us change that. Make Him our priority in good &amp; bad times!"
2575,2019-06-11 23:26:05+00:00,muftimenk,Take time out to disconnect from your surroundings occasionally. Enjoy your own company because it’s easy to get overwhelmed by life &amp; all that it offers. Keep your heart connected to the One who made you &amp; you’ll achieve that inner peace &amp; contentment that we all badly need!
2576,2019-06-11 12:06:35+00:00,muftimenk,"When something is not right &amp; you feel yourself drifting away from the Almighty, reflect &amp; analyse your situation. What took you away &amp; distracted you from Him? Remember, when you’ve had a bad harvest, you fix the environment, not the crop. Get to the source of the problem!"
2577,2019-06-11 03:01:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you among those who when asked for advice, you hardly ever try to understand the person’s unique situation &amp; needs; you give advice based on your own bitterness &amp; cynicism; you live in a constant state of dissatisfaction. If that’s you, it’s time to be more compassionate!"
2578,2019-06-10 16:25:33+00:00,muftimenk,Some people just thrive being in the spotlight. They put on a show for everyone to see. They love being praised; it does wonders to their egos. They’ll create dramas just to be the centre of focus. Minimize your dealings with them if possible. Don’t get drawn into their circle.
2579,2019-06-10 04:29:01+00:00,muftimenk,"People are generally stingy with compliments. Often, the recognition you hope for simply isn’t going to happen. So when people fail to acknowledge what you’ve done, don’t take it to heart. Let your reward be with the Almighty. Work for His applause rather than other people’s!"
2580,2019-06-09 21:02:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have friends who are  constantly complaining about other people or judging other people. They will make no effort to hide their discontent and they’ll try to drag you into their pit of despair, except they won’t even realize that they are the source of the discontent!"
2581,2019-06-09 12:42:44+00:00,muftimenk,"We can’t control other people’s perceptions of us but what we can do is to gain control over our own thoughts. Doing so will allow us to add value to our life &amp; build meaningful bonds with those around us. But no matter what others do, the Almighty will always be there for us!"
2582,2019-06-08 19:41:48+00:00,muftimenk,"So you’re having issues with your health, your finances, your marriage, your children and the list goes on. You’re going through heartache and disappointment; you feel overwhelmed; close to giving up! Keep asking the Almighty. Nothing is too big for the Lord of the Worlds!"
2583,2019-06-08 09:59:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Our lives can end in a heartbeat. The Almighty can take us anytime. It has nothing to do with age so don’t be deceived! Young or old, when it’s your time, you’ll go. Be prepared. Don’t be caught up in this world with never-ending desires. Because that’s what Satan does best!"
2584,2019-06-07 21:09:32+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think you’re in the worst situation ever but you forget that where you are right now is NOT your final destination. Keep going. The Almighty will bring you from trial to victory, from feeling lost to feeling on top of the world. No one can stop His Plans for you."
2585,2019-06-07 08:02:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you guilty of this? Treating people badly, using them to serve your purpose only. Examine yourself constantly to make sure you’re not doing this. Because you can’t keep treating people badly, expecting the Almighty to do nothing about it. What goes around comes around!"
2586,2019-06-06 22:12:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, guide us towards doing good deeds for Your sake only. Give us the strength to be steadfast, enduring the trials You send our way. Grant us a soft heart, always content with Your Decree. Grant us sincerity, happiness &amp; success &amp; protect us from harm."

Bitterness keeps you stuck in the present situation. Let it go. Choose to move forward &amp; keep positive, knowing that the Almighty has your back. Always!"
2589,2019-06-05 23:14:17+00:00,muftimenk,Many people make the mistake thinking that a confident person is the one who is better than everyone else. That is far from the truth. Confidence isn't strutting into a room thinking you're better than everyone else; it's walking in not having to compare yourself to anyone.
2590,2019-06-05 11:05:33+00:00,muftimenk,"What you do away from the public eye speaks a lot about you. It shows your true character. Don’t think no one knows or sees it because the Almighty knows everything about you, both done publicly and in private. He knows what has happened, what will happen &amp; how it will happen!"
2591,2019-06-05 01:35:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Our journey is paved with sad and happy moments. That’s how it is. No matter what the Almighty places in our path, keep putting one foot in front of the other, even when it hurts. No one knows what lies ahead but the One who made us. Trust that He only wants what’s good for us!"
2592,2019-06-04 17:35:18+00:00,muftimenk,May the Almighty fill our hearts with compassion on this beautiful day. Spread the joy of #Eid to all around you and don’t forget to reach out to those in need. #EidMubarak to all of you. Have a beautiful time with your loved ones.

2595,2019-06-03 14:30:26+00:00,muftimenk,"All the prayers you’ve been making, the dreams you’ve been wanting so badly, trust the Almighty because He has got it under control. He is going to ensure that things fall into place. He is going to make things happen that you could never have done on your own. Have firm faith!"
2596,2019-06-03 05:51:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever goals you’re setting, often it’s better to keep that thought to yourself. Not everyone is a well-wisher. While you’re telling someone about your next ambitious move, they might not always want the best for you. There’s a lot of competition and jealousy out there!"
2597,2019-06-02 22:10:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Make a commitment to a fresh  start, a new beginning when #Ramadan ends. Give up at least one bad habit in this blessed month. Do it solely for the sake of the Almighty. All the good we have done should not come to an end with the end of the month. Hold on to them. Start anew!"
2598,2019-06-02 12:07:35+00:00,muftimenk,Stop stressing yourself over how your life is going to turn out. Nobody has it all figured out. Only the One who made you knows what will happen. So live your life the best way you can and attach your heart to the One who matters most. It’s one sure way to attain contentment!
2599,2019-06-02 00:02:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fall into the trap of Satan who makes you believe that happiness comes with getting all that your heart desires. The more you have, the happier you’ll be? That’s a lie! In fact, it’s furthest from the truth. Happiness is appreciating all that you have been blessed with."

2601,2019-06-01 13:28:55+00:00,muftimenk,"On Judgement Day, the Almighty will weigh your deeds &amp; not count them. More than the numbers, He looks at how much heart you put in while doing the deed; the state of your heart at that time. Who went out of their way to do it solely for Him &amp; who did it to show off?"
2602,2019-06-01 00:35:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you guilty of deriving pleasure from the misfortune of others? Something bad happens to someone else and you secretly take pleasure from it. Be careful. It shows a poisonous heart which willl get worse if you don’t check it. Empathize, be kind and show compassion instead!"
2603,2019-05-31 11:25:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, your end goal is Paradise. So everything that you’ve been doing during this blessed month of Ramadan should continue when the month ends. Don’t let up. Don’t make it a short-term goal. Paradise is the ultimate destination in this lifelong journey. Strive to get there."
2604,2019-05-30 22:14:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to guide us to the best of manners. Grant us sound faith and conviction.  Forgive all our sins; the small, the major, those done privately and openly. Grant our soul its strength and purify it for You have complete power over it! Aameen."
2605,2019-05-30 06:29:19+00:00,muftimenk,The trouble with us is too often we are so focused on what we hope the Almighty will do for us in the near future that we forget to see what He is doing right now. Trust Him because He’s doing a lot. He has a plan for each and everyone of us. Our job is to keep going.
2606,2019-05-29 15:27:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us the strength, to go through these most blessed nights of #Ramadan. We ask You to accept all our prayers, fasts, charity and good deeds, done solely for Your Sake. If You’re pleased with us, nothing else matters! May we end this blessed month on a high note!"
2607,2019-05-29 05:38:43+00:00,muftimenk,"The past is the past. You can't change it &amp; whatever has happened is out of your control. Truth is, the past can hurt, but it's also what you make of it. Choose to let those memories go. Learn whatever lessons you can but don’t dwell &amp; keep harping on them. Lighten your load!"
2608,2019-05-28 16:06:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do, don’t quit. Quitting is not an option. It never is! You’re closer to your  goal than you think. No matter what happened in the past, what took place yesterday, today’s a brand new day. The Almighty has great plans for you. Trust Him and get back on track!"
2609,2019-05-28 06:10:09+00:00,muftimenk,"In our ever-connected world, where we’re being bombarded daily with too much information, learn to disconnect and seek inner focus. It’s especially important to control distractions when you’re plugging in with the Almighty! Fight the urge to be connected at all times! #Ramadan"
2610,2019-05-27 12:36:29+00:00,muftimenk,"What is this life but a marathon, one that’s customised for each &amp; every person. To win this race, you mustn’t give up. You must keep going &amp; cross the finish line. There’ll be many distractions along the way. Don’t give in to them. Keep your heart &amp; mind focused on your goal."
2611,2019-05-26 22:41:43+00:00,muftimenk,How do you react to things? The ball is in your court. The choice is yours. You know you’ll be tested often so what do you do? Get angry &amp; sink into depression or you can respond with beautiful patience; knowing the Almighty is in full control. Put your full faith in Him! Trust!
2612,2019-05-26 02:52:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Change isn’t easy. Even when you want it to happen. But if you’re serious about wanting to make your life better, you need to embrace change. Seek the Almighty for strength &amp; comfort. It requires more energy than you think. Use these blessed days to make it a reality!"
2613,2019-05-25 16:15:37+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want to feel the sweetness of worship, cleanse your heart. A diseased heart won’t be at ease. Make a conscious effort to get rid of pride, hatred, envy &amp; anything that gets in the way of being fully focused on the Almighty. It won’t happen overnight but you’ll get there."
2614,2019-05-25 06:35:55+00:00,muftimenk,Search your own heart. Could it be that your suspicion of the ulterior motives of others is because you’re prone to doing the same? Increase the habit of praising others &amp; let thankfulness overflow to the Almighty when someone does something good to you. Try it. You’ll feel good!
2615,2019-05-24 22:47:02+00:00,muftimenk,"As we enter the ten most blessed nights, include us among those who fasted this #Ramadan properly, attained the goodness of #LaylatulQadr &amp; having made efforts to get closer to You! Guide us to make the most of the days left, raise our status &amp; forgive all our sins. Aameen!"
2616,2019-05-24 05:47:04+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’ve managed to clean up your act so far in this blessed month, that’s really commendable. Make a commitment to never let anger, envy, hatred, malice, slander, gossip, backbiting, obscene talk, swear words and the likes from your mouth, come back into your life again!"
2617,2019-05-23 22:14:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, hide our faults, forgive our sins, save us from disgrace in this world &amp; the next. When we start losing hope or begin to doubt ourselves, remind us that Your Plans are always better than we could ever imagine! Keep our hearts firmly attached to You!"
2618,2019-05-23 05:30:30+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty is the Most Wise. Whatever we’re going through now, it’s crucial to remember He knows what’s best for us. Though we shy away from facing our worries &amp; fears, it may be that we hate a thing that is good for us &amp; desire something that can only lead to our destruction."
2619,2019-05-22 21:49:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t just focus on how you can make your life better, look for ways to make someone else’s life better too. Often, it’s hard to find someone willing to go out of their way to help those in need. When you’re able to do that, then you will achieve satisfaction &amp; true contentment."
2620,2019-05-22 12:21:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let people make you feel bad for not conforming to their way of life &amp; habits. You’re answerable to the Almighty for all your actions, not to the rest of the people. You can’t live a life where your every action is dictated by people who aren’t even concerned about you!"
2621,2019-05-21 22:35:30+00:00,muftimenk,Try and do something each day to bring a smile on your parents face. Show them the love and appreciation that they deserve for all that they’ve done for you. Don’t be among those who neglect them and see their worth only after they’ve left this world. Don’t live with the regret!
2622,2019-05-21 08:21:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Failures, faults and frustration. We’ve all been through them. But never let them consume you. The Almighty knows what you’re going through at all times. He knows your fears. He hears your prayers even when you can’t find the right words. Hand over all these and more to Him!"
2623,2019-05-20 23:00:43+00:00,muftimenk,"As we cross the halfway mark in #Ramadan take stock of how you’re progressing. It’s never too late. The most crucial thing is to finish strong as we head towards the last ten nights. Keep going. The Almighty knows &amp; sees all your efforts, no matter how small. He will reward you"
2624,2019-05-20 14:00:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes an evil plot against you will be the very means by which you will be granted greater growth &amp; success, more than what the plotters ever imagined! Don't despair. Don't give up. The Almighty knows &amp; He is with you! Pick up the pieces &amp; press ahead with your own plans!"
2625,2019-05-20 08:40:52+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s important to keep an inner sense of calm about you. When dark stormy clouds of doubt, anger or worry start creeping in, always remind yourself that nothing lasts. Every storm shall pass. The Almighty is testing you and will continue to do so until you lay your trust in Him!"
2626,2019-05-19 22:17:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Constant positive reminders benefit us more than we can imagine. Revelation from the Almighty contains repeated reminders; though worded differently at times, they’re meant for deep reflection to bring about positive change. Don't be irritated by the repetition of good messages!"
2627,2019-05-19 08:03:38+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re always making assumptions about others, you damage your capacity to relate to them. You’re always assuming you know how they think &amp; feel, so you stop  listening &amp; communicating, leading to misunderstanding. Be mindful of this. It can spiral into negative thinking!"
2628,2019-05-18 16:06:24+00:00,muftimenk,"We all go through struggles in life. Everyone of us without exception. So don’t feel depressed. Obstacles keep us on our toes. Just because time seems tough now, does not mean it will remain this way forever. Nothing lasts. Focus on the big reward the Almighty has promised!"
2629,2019-05-18 02:04:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn not to tell people more than they need to know. This can be difficult but be conscious of the information that you choose to divulge. People have no business to know everything about you. The less you tell, the better for you. It can save you from a whole lot of trouble."
2630,2019-05-17 17:21:19+00:00,muftimenk,"If anyone tries to draw you into an argument, gossip, backbiting &amp; the likes, simply excuse  yourself &amp; say, “I am fasting”. Just as we are concerned about what goes into our mouths, what comes out of it is equally important! Be mindful. Don’t shortchange yourself. #Ramadhan"
2631,2019-05-17 09:11:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Making peace with your inner self is important. It starts from the inside first. It could mean mending broken relationships that have been bugging you, strengthening existing ones or simply making sense of your negative feelings. Let go of resentments. Don’t wait. Start now."
2632,2019-05-16 22:27:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to forgive all our sins. You know how much we have transgressed and how many sins we have committed. Do not take us to account for our lack of attention. Do not punish us for messing up repeatedly. Please continue to be patient with us."
2633,2019-05-16 12:08:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't take anything for granted. You never know when you'll have it for the last time. Life is a precious gift, cherish every moment while you can. It’s truly such a blessing to be alive &amp; to be able to impact the lives of others. You’ll never know whose life you’re touching."
2634,2019-05-16 05:16:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t underestimate any act of kindness, no matter how small you think it is. Every act of kindness is a seed. All seeds will grow eventually and produce a harvest for you to reap the reward. Never tire of doing good and a bountiful harvest of blessings will be yours!"
2635,2019-05-15 17:19:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t put off till tomorrow what you should do today. When you have the “one day” attitude, you’ll miss out on a lot of goodness in #Ramadan. You refuse to see what the Almighty is dangling in front of you right now. Don’t end up the loser by being a procrastinator!"
2636,2019-05-15 03:22:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Before speaking bad about others, ask yourself; if present, would the person spoken about dislike &amp; become unhappy about what you’re saying? If so, then consider staying quiet. It is better to communicate directly with someone than to speak about others behind their backs!"
2637,2019-05-14 21:13:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be fooled into thinking that everyone is your friend. Just because they hang around you doesn’t mean they are your friends. People pretend well. They will laugh with you &amp; joke around with you. At the end of the day, when push  comes to shove, they’ll be exposed. Take heed."
2638,2019-05-14 08:41:44+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how ashamed you are of the sins you’ve committed, turn back to the Almighty. Nothing is too small for Him. Seek forgiveness constantly. While we will continue to struggle with wrong actions, they must not be a reason for us to despair. Never lose hope in His Mercy."
2639,2019-05-13 22:28:36+00:00,muftimenk,"We’re almost a third into the month of #Ramadan. May the Almighty accept our fast &amp; acts of worship! How do you think you’re doing so far? Have you developed a routine, are you struggling to fit in extra prayers &amp; time to reflect? It’s not too late!"
2640,2019-05-13 17:26:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be narrow-minded &amp; think of doing things only for yourself. It’ll frustrate you; you’ll want something more. Learn to do things for others. Learn to help any which way you can. When you help others, it opens the door for you to be blessed! Do it without batting an eyelid."
2641,2019-05-13 05:28:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Pray for those who've passed away &amp; prepare for the day you &amp; I will leave this world. Today, we've lost a legend. Ebrahim Gangat. You were loved by millions &amp; will surely be missed. Your legacy lives on. May your shortcomings be forgiven &amp; may you be granted Paradise. Aameen."
2642,2019-05-13 03:55:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep asking the Almighty to replace our sadness with hope, anxiety with reassurance, depression with happiness, weakness with strength. May we fully rely on Him for everything. Keep our faith firm &amp; unflinching. Mend our brokenness and keep us on the straight path always!"
2643,2019-05-12 15:31:18+00:00,muftimenk,"The paths to Paradise are many. Fasting is one of them. Don’t waste it. #Ramadan is not any ordinary month. When you fast, your hearing, sight &amp; tongue should also fast. Don’t engage in acts that will spoil it. Don’t let the day you fast be the same as the day you don’t fast!"
2644,2019-05-12 03:19:34+00:00,muftimenk,The scars we get in life are proof of inner strength. They show us that we’re all warriors really; even if we were gasping for air for a while. We’re no longer reaching for those who don’t bother to give us their hand. We’ve learnt that only the Almighty will helps us. Only Him.
2645,2019-05-11 17:38:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t make it your business to gossip about those who are trying hard to improve themselves. Pray for them instead. Motivate &amp; encourage, add a good word but never put them down. Don’t be arrogant &amp; think you’ve got it all good. No one is perfect. We are all a work in progress."
2646,2019-05-11 04:47:07+00:00,muftimenk,Read the signs when the Almighty’s telling you to move on. Don’t put a question mark where He has put a full stop. It’s not in our capacity to fully comprehend all that’s going on. Only He does. Our job is to trust Him. But know that He will heal the pain &amp; mend the broken heart!
2647,2019-05-10 17:02:06+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t stress over things you can’t control. Hand it over to the Almighty. There’s no need to spend sleepless nights thinking about your problems. It’ll get you nowhere. He can easily take care of things if only you’d trust Him. He’s the only One who can turn your life around.
2648,2019-05-10 00:23:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, in this blessed month, make us among those who fast sincerely for Your sake. May You accept our worship and nights in prayer which we do in full submission. Keep us away from heedlessness and forgive all our sins. Aameen."
2649,2019-05-09 11:16:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Let us work on our hearts. Recharge, rejuvenate, rekindle, renew, revitalize, revive, reactivate &amp; get closer to the Almighty. If not now, then when? #Ramadan"
2650,2019-05-08 23:33:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Make it a habit to pray for others. Remember, the ripple effect from prayer is simply remarkable. When you pray for others, good things come to you. The Almighty is engaged in helping someone as long as he is engaged in helping someone else. So don’t be stingy. Start doing it!"
2651,2019-05-08 12:36:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Hypocrites love to gossip, they love to know what everyone else is doing; their ins and outs. They may even make up gossip if it’s not juicy enough. It can be hurtful and upsetting when you are the subject of the untruthful gossip. Confront them peacefully and pray for them!"
2652,2019-05-08 04:33:27+00:00,muftimenk,Be careful when you blurt out harsh words in harsh tones. The hurt might pierce deeper than you could ever imagine. You probably think a simple sorry can fix it. But think again. Words can leave scars. Some scars are more permanent than others.
2653,2019-05-07 21:45:11+00:00,muftimenk,"This #Ramadan, make a firm commitment to use words to build people up. Stop using foul language, bad speech &amp; don’t curse &amp; swear. Words are powerful. They leave a lasting impact. So let nothing else but good come out of your mouth. The effects will resonate far and wide."
2654,2019-05-07 09:30:54+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to get discouraged and feel let down when things are rough. Everyone has disappointments, everyone has bad days but if you’re firm in faith and trust the Almighty fully,  He will find a way out for you and you wouldn’t even remember whatever pain you had to endure."
2655,2019-05-06 23:31:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Soften our hearts for #Ramadan. Renew our link with the Almighty &amp; celebrate revelation of the greatest message from our Lord. For a blessed month that's bountiful with deeds, repent sincerely. Commit to change for the better &amp; discard old habits!"
2656,2019-05-06 08:14:32+00:00,muftimenk,"A person who is content with what the Almighty provides for him will enjoy tranquility, satisfaction &amp; peace of mind, as he does not long for what others have, or desire what he does not possess. If you’re content with what He has given you, you’ll be the richest person!"
2657,2019-05-05 21:57:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Why do we commence Ramadan a day earlier or later than others? For a simple answer, watch this video.

2658,2019-05-05 21:48:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Whether your #Ramadan started today or will start tomorrow, I wish every one of you the most blessed &amp; spiritually elevating month. May the Almighty keep us steadfast and make us better people."
2659,2019-05-04 21:42:27+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to be overwhelmed by all that’s going on &amp; get distracted from your main goal. With #Ramadhan just days away, keep reminding yourself of what’s important. Don’t spend time on futile activities that keep you away from worshipping the Almighty. Stay focus. Be consistent!"
2660,2019-05-04 14:59:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you realize that death is chasing us just like we’re chasing this temporary world? Today, many souls left us &amp; the same will happen tomorrow. The truth is we're clueless when our time will come. Let us be prepared &amp; always be in a state of obedience to our Lord! Turn to Him!"
2661,2019-05-04 06:19:07+00:00,muftimenk,Your real test comes when things are not going your way not just when things are smooth sailing. Do you trust the Almighty when you can’t figure out what’s going on? Do you take it in your stride &amp; bear patience even though you don't understand His Plan?
2662,2019-05-03 20:54:29+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s easy to be overwhelmed by all that’s going on &amp; get distracted from your main goal. With #Ramadan just days away, keep reminding yourself of what’s important. Don’t spend time on futile activities that keep you away from worshipping the Almighty. Stay focus. Be consistent!"
2663,2019-05-03 11:37:26+00:00,muftimenk,Satan is always working hard to pull you away from the straight path. So you must be on guard against him. Never allow yourself to be trapped by Satan and his troops. They’ll make you feel hopeless. Remain steadfast in repentance and be assured of divine mercy and forgiveness.
2664,2019-05-03 03:15:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You for contentment with whatever You have decreed for us. Let us go through it, bearing full patience, knowing You’re in control. Guide us to the best of manners, repel all that’s bad from us; forgive all our sins and purify our hearts!"
2665,2019-05-02 16:18:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Focus is crucial in our relationship with the Almighty, especially in this age of distraction. This focus is not only meant for our daily prayers, but should stretch to every aspect of our lives. Living a distracted life leads nowhere as you’ll fall prey to the tricks of Satan!"
2666,2019-05-02 07:38:45+00:00,muftimenk,"If there’s nothing more important in one’s life than prayer, why is it that we don’t place enough importance on it. Some even neglect it. How can we expect to have success in this world &amp; the next when we turn a deaf ear to the call to success daily? Let's change our priorities"
2667,2019-05-01 20:35:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to trust the Almighty without an iota of doubt. Remember, you don’t have all the answers but He does. He is Lord of the Worlds. He is the asnswer to all your woes. He is our Provider, Sustainer, Nourisher, Healer, Comforter, Protector and everything that you need!"
2668,2019-05-01 08:21:15+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re one of those who loves to procrastinate, now’s the time to change this bad habit. Some suffer mild symptoms, delaying simple tasks; others allow it to control their lives, to the point that it disrupts their connection with the Almighty. Don’t fall prey. Act now!"
2669,2019-04-30 22:22:59+00:00,muftimenk,Think back to the last sin you committed. The one before &amp; the one before that &amp; so on... How many promises did you make to repent &amp; how many times did you fail to keep it? Turn back to the Almighty. We don’t know if there will be a next time. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone!
2670,2019-04-30 11:51:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Smokers become very defensive when reminded that they need to quit the bad habit. There are so many reasons to do so; it’s a waste of money, secondhand smoke harms others &amp; smoking actually kills! Take control of your life before it’s too late. Be strong &amp; quit it once &amp; for all!"
2671,2019-04-30 05:21:26+00:00,muftimenk,"If you think you're the only one serving the Almighty or doing good, think again. Your effort may be significant but it’s not the only method of good. Millions are doing good work. Don't belittle their efforts. Don't abuse them. Support them. The Almighty uses whoever He wishes."
2672,2019-04-29 22:25:53+00:00,muftimenk,Never take any good deed lightly. A good deed is never insignificant &amp; should neither be ignored nor looked upon as trivial. We never know which deed will be the key to our Paradise. It could be that a deed we consider small and insignificant might be so pleasing to the Almighty!
2673,2019-04-29 13:42:46+00:00,muftimenk,"What is this life? We all know that this worldly life is temporary. It’s nothing but an illusion, play &amp; amusement. It will trick you. It will entice you. And yet we spend a disproportionate amount of time on it, forgetting to build our everlasting life in the Hereafter."
2674,2019-04-29 07:17:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you sometimes feel that nobody really understands what you're going through? Well, the truth is nobody does except the Almighty. He’s always there for you, always available to listen to you, help you, heal you, sustain you, protect you, watch over you &amp; make you whole again!"
2675,2019-04-29 00:43:06+00:00,muftimenk,Satan will trick you into the joy of sin which lasts only momentarily. Be careful not to fall for his antics because what will happen thereafter is everlasting regret and remorse. Protect yourself and build an armour against him with the continuous remembrance of the Almighty.
2676,2019-04-28 09:55:06+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has bestowed each one of us with something special. What you do with it depends on your attitude. Will you use it to achieve your full potential or will you be distracted by what others have &amp; keep comparing with them? Remember, it’s your journey as decreed by Him!"
2677,2019-04-28 03:37:08+00:00,muftimenk,"What are we actually chasing in this life? Looks fade, money goes; what’s left? When that happens, it’s your personal relationship with the Almighty that stays. That’s the only thing that matters really. He will guide you and provide a way out for you in every circumstance."
2678,2019-04-27 09:36:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Ultimately, even the best of deeds may come to nothing if the hearts are sick; if the hearts are corrupt. So the heart plays a major role &amp; deserves great attention. Seek the Almighty’s help often to rid the heart of major diseases - hatred, envy etc. Keep purifying your intent!"
2679,2019-04-26 22:30:51+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what’s going on, always uphold good character and conduct. Let people criticise, let them pick on petty issues, let them say nasty things. Be good and kind-hearted even if they aren’t. Rise above it. What goes around comes around. Remember there’s Judgement Day!"
2680,2019-04-26 09:27:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Holding on to your faith in the midst of suffering is not for the faint-hearted. There’s purpose in the pain, everything happens for a reason. You may not realize it now, but when you look back, you’ll understand the Almighty’s Plan for you. So ride out the storm and trust Him."
2681,2019-04-26 01:03:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to forgive our sins and continue to be patient with us. We ask You to overlook our shortcomings and accept the little that we’ve done. We are in need of Your Mercy always. Keep our hearts attached to You and those who remind us of You."
2682,2019-04-25 18:40:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Stress can be more harmful than merely affecting your physical health. Mentally, it causes you to crumble. You lose hope, faith &amp; trust. Inner peace can only be achieved by remembering the Almighty frequently and asking for His help &amp; forgiveness in times of difficulties."
2683,2019-04-24 19:55:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to use other’s success as inspiration. Instead of focusing on our failure, we can see their achievement as something to motivate us. If he did it, so can we; our time will come! We can be proactive, evaluate their success &amp; see how we can apply it to improve our own lives."
2684,2019-04-24 09:18:05+00:00,muftimenk,"True patience is when, regardless of how harsh life gets, you remember the beautiful things the Almighty has promised you. You keep enduring no matter how horrible you feel inside. You know it won’t last. You never inflict pain on others or let it affect how you treat them."
2685,2019-04-24 00:14:02+00:00,muftimenk,"When you hold on to hurt, resentment or a grudge, you are not going to be able to understand the Almighty’s Plan for you because your heart has hardened. Bad thoughts &amp; negativity surround you. You become defensive &amp; cold-hearted. You care about little else. Lighten your load!"
2686,2019-04-23 12:33:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Life’s not a sprint but a marathon. Stop being so hard on yourself &amp; embrace your journey. It’s preparing you for the Hereafter. It won’t be paved with roses, be wary of the thorns along the way. Your plans won’t always be the way you planned it but the way the Almighty wants it!"
2687,2019-04-22 23:22:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t pay heed to people who talk behind your back. You can’t stop them. What everyone else has to say, think, or feel about how you live your life does not and should not affect your happiness or state of mind. It’s really about them, not you. Realize this before it's too late."
2688,2019-04-22 15:18:13+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what your circumstance, remember the Almighty always has the final say. He will make good everything that wasn’t right &amp; you’ll be amazed. So don’t let the actions of others get in your way &amp; hinder you. Let them say what they will. He controls your destiny; not them!"
2689,2019-04-22 05:19:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Some won’t understand you. Some won’t support you. Some will leave you. Some won’t even care if you’re down in the dumps. But no matter what others put you through, your Creator will always be there for you. He knows every moment of your struggle. He will compensate you greatly"
2690,2019-04-21 19:48:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Jumping to conclusions is one of the most common forms of negative thinking. You usually jump to a negative conclusion without any justifiable facts of the situation. As a result, you become negative, depressed, anxious, sad or angry. Put a stop to it. Change your mindset!"
2691,2019-04-21 08:00:39+00:00,muftimenk,I strongly condemn the #SriLankaAttacks. Many were killed this morning while attending church services. This is totally unacceptable. We firmly believe in peaceful coexistence. My thoughts are with the victims &amp; their families. #PrayForPeace #PrayForSriLanka #SriLanka
2692,2019-04-21 00:53:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Strengthen your faith daily through good deeds. Kindness with your tongue, charity with your wealth, render help where possible. Stay connected to the Almighty. We cannot expect to strengthen our ties with Him and increase our faith if we only worship Him when we feel like it!"
2693,2019-04-20 14:14:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remember, your value is not based on what you look like, what you do, or who you know, your status in life! Also you are not defined by your past. Use the past to learn lessons for the present and future. Your true value comes from how close you are to your Creator!"
2694,2019-04-20 07:27:37+00:00,muftimenk,We live in an age of envy. Where envy is being taken to extremes. People are generallly dissatisfied with their lives because they can’t achieve the lifestyle they want but which they see others have. This is dangerous. Be grateful for what you have before you lose it all.
2695,2019-04-20 01:02:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep praying, keep asking. The Almighty is All-Knowing. Never doubt that He’s aware of the goings-on in your life. He will grant you strength in times of need, peace in chaos, hope in helplessness and will lift you when you feel down. All you have to do is trust Him. Completely!"
2696,2019-04-19 17:09:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t get complacent with life &amp; choose to stay in your comfort zone. That’s not what the Almighty wants us to do. That’s why He tests us again &amp; again; to stretch us, to grow, to learn new things &amp; to rise to new levels. He’s given us the capacity to do it. He knows our limits!"
2697,2019-04-19 08:35:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray for our children. May You grant them a heart of faith, keep them healthy &amp; heal all those who are ill. Bless them with good, righteous friends &amp;  those who will remind them of You. Grant them a strong sense of right &amp; wrong &amp; keep them safe!"
2698,2019-04-18 10:53:11+00:00,muftimenk,Understand the tricks of Satan. He will try his best to make the forbidden so attractive to you. He convinces you that lust is love. He makes your heart flutter by planting such thoughts in you. Be strong enough to ignore it. Work on pleasing the Almighty. He will reward you!
2699,2019-04-17 19:13:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t underestimate the endless ripple effect of any act of goodness and kindness, no matter how small it is. Sooner or later, it will make its way back to you. Remember, what goes around, comes around. Perhaps not immediately but trust the Almighty to reward you eventually!"
2700,2019-04-17 09:08:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Give people the time and space they need to to heal from their hurt. Don’t rush them. We all deal with trials and tribulations in our own unique ways. Lend an ear, lend a helping hand, make sure they know you’re there if they need you. That’s the best help you can offer!"
2701,2019-04-16 16:33:24+00:00,muftimenk,Take a break from social media periodically. Reconnect with the real world. Plug in to real people &amp; places around you. Find time to actually see someone in person instead of sending them a message online. Connections with family &amp; friends are more meaningful face to face!
2702,2019-04-16 10:26:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t engage small-minded, petty people unless you’re able to help them. What you say &amp; do will never be good enough for them. They’ll make your life difficult. Focus on controlling our own actions. We can’t allow ourselves to get sucked into their madness or we’ll end up hurt!"
2703,2019-04-15 23:04:00+00:00,muftimenk,"When your heart is at ease &amp; you reach the level of trust in the Almighty, without any reservation, you don’t stress over life. You let Him do what He wills. If He opens a door for you, thank Him; if it doesn’t open, you still thank Him. That’s the beauty of complete trust!"
2704,2019-04-15 16:02:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Today, it's just so easy to take pictures of all the good things going on in your life, post them on social media &amp; to a random person looking at your feed it may look like that's how your life always is. Who are we fooling? Ourselves! Be wary not to believe your online life!"
2705,2019-04-15 05:29:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Treat your spouse kindly and do not resort to abuse in any form. Lack of kindness is often the source of marital conflicts &amp; the cause of most divorce. Anger, selfish or irresponsible behavior &amp; criticism have a huge impact on kindness. It will threaten your marriage bit by bit!"
2706,2019-04-14 16:39:34+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be so hard on yourself. Address today’s problems with the capacity you’ve been given. Don’t start worrying about what’s to come tomorrow &amp; whether you’ll be able to handle it. Leave that till tomorrow. Do your best. The Almighty won’t burden you with more than you can bear!
2707,2019-04-14 07:54:24+00:00,muftimenk,Social media has given haters &amp; detractors a platform to take a swipe &amp; abuse freely. Don't be dragged into a war of words by trying to respond to every negative comment online. You'll be playing straight into their hands. Leave it be. The Almighty knows &amp; so do the fair-minded.
2708,2019-04-13 20:37:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, no one in your life is perfect. Stop expecting them to be perfect. There’s no such thing. Such people don’t exist. You’re setting yourself up for a huge disappointment if you expect perfection. We are all humans &amp; we make mistakes. Accept it &amp; you’ll be a lot happier!"
2709,2019-04-13 14:26:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Prayer is not about you getting something from the Almighty as &amp; when you want it. It’s more than that. The act of connecting with Him, building your relationship with Him, how you ask Him - all these play a part. Keep the communication going daily, not just when in need!"
2710,2019-04-13 00:31:30+00:00,muftimenk,The most important thing you can do when you’ve done something wrong is to have the courage to own up and admit your fault. Aplogise to the people you’ve wronged. Don’t look for excuses or scapegoats. A sincere apology shows you’re taking responsibility for your own action.
2711,2019-04-12 10:40:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t think that you’ve nothing to offer those around you, no matter how insignificant you feel it is. Always remember that you add value to the people you mix with. You’ve something to give everyone; whether it’s your time, a smile, a prayer, an encouraging word or lend a hand!"
2712,2019-04-12 00:51:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, protect us from the greed of our own soul. You know the struggle against worldly pleasures, hypocrisy &amp; insincerity, hatred &amp; envy, arrogance &amp; pride etc. Help us to purify our hearts against such evil traits which Satan has beautified!"
2713,2019-04-11 19:23:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Beautiful patience is a gift. Not everyone has it. It’s the ability to accept what happens at the first  sign of a calamity and the ability to hold on to that patience till the trial is over. No complaining, no whinging, just a calm accepting heart from the start till the end!"
2714,2019-04-10 21:29:16+00:00,muftimenk,"We all have our scars. We all have broken pieces. But the beauty in all that is they come together to create the real you! The you who survived the pain &amp; hardship, the you who emerged stronger, kinder and more compassionate! The you who’s ready for whatever life dishes out!"
2715,2019-04-10 14:54:01+00:00,muftimenk,Hiding behind anonymity to attack others on social media is a cheap act of cowardice. Respectful people use their real identity to address matters of importance in a dignified manner. Anonymous insults hold no value. They’re worthless. Ignore them.
2716,2019-04-10 05:04:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Sins are almost always associated with an accompanying sense of guilt. While we can always turn a blind eye to those guilty feelings, we know that such guilt will slowly chip away at our happiness. Repentance will remove that guilt and fill our hearts with calmness &amp; tranquility!"
2717,2019-04-09 16:27:35+00:00,muftimenk,"The turnout at today's #BuildingBridges event in #Zamboanga, #Philippines was amazing. May the Almighty bless you all. Aameen #muftimenk #lovepreacher https://t.co/GxeEuwQ1Cn"
2718,2019-04-09 14:01:16+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty’s Plan for us doesn’t have to be a mystery. If we trust Him, do what He asks, His Plan will unfold in our lives like a brightly lit path. If you are trying to follow His Guidance, but you find yourself confronted with obstacles and hardship, don’t despair. He knows!"
2719,2019-04-09 05:53:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Make a commitment that you’ll  henceforth spend a lot of time working on your shortcomings &amp; your link with the Almighty, leaving no time to judge &amp; criticize others. You’ll channel your energy towards becoming a better version of yourself &amp; strive towards positivity &amp; goodness!"
2720,2019-04-08 13:02:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have true friends? Those who will tell you the truth, no matter how it hurts. Those who are happy for your success. Those who are by your side, comforting you when times are bad. And those who will remind you of the Almighty at all times, drawing you closer to Him!"
2721,2019-04-08 03:25:11+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of social media, it’s almost second nature for some to do good deeds and then show off to the world what they’ve done. Don’t! Try to keep some deeds secret; only between you and the Almighty. No matter how small it is, to Him it could weigh heavily on your scales!"
2722,2019-04-07 17:58:06+00:00,muftimenk,"We’re bombarded with the temptation to be popular daily. The pressure to do what others are doing. Don’t fall into this trap. Even if “everyone is doing it,” wrong is never right. Evil, wrongdoings &amp; darkness will never be the truth, even if popular. Let your faith stand firm!"
2723,2019-04-07 05:05:27+00:00,muftimenk,"If you feel like you’re always giving &amp; never on the receiving end, be grateful. It’s like that with some people who won’t hesitate to take &amp; take; but will think many times over before giving. Remember, at the end of the day, your reward’s with the Almighty. Nothing escapes Him!"
2724,2019-04-06 22:36:14+00:00,muftimenk,"We have to accept that regardless of what we want in this world and regardless of whether or not we get it, we’re still going to want more and so much more. That’s just the nature of Man. Learn to focus more on what’s to come, the Hereafter. You’ll be the happiest person!"
2725,2019-04-06 14:32:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Shift your focus from what’s bad to what’s good; from pain to  passion; from resentment &amp; holding grudges to forgiveness, gratitude &amp; appreciation. Stay positive &amp; hopeful, knowing that the Almighty wants only good for us. Keep spreading goodness &amp; it will come back to you!"
2726,2019-04-06 05:16:23+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty can heal every heart and the hurt inside, mend everything that’s broken, guide every decision and lead us to the path of righteousness. It’s not difficult for Him. He’s the Lord of the Worlds. You have to do your part and He will do the rest. Leave it to Him!"
2727,2019-04-05 17:48:55+00:00,muftimenk,"When your heart is in the right place, you’ll be sensitive to being unduly praised. You feel uncomfortable. Although people who praise you may be well-meaning, such praise only reminds you of your limitations and weakness. May the Almighty keep us humble at all times!"
2728,2019-04-05 07:54:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, give us the strength &amp; courage to stay firm &amp; hold on to our faith &amp; belief. Don’t make us among those who lose ourselves in a crowd just because we want to fit in. Help us to worry less about what people think of us. Only You matter in the end!"
2729,2019-04-04 22:50:02+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future. Live in the present moment and appreciate everything that the Almighty has bestowed on you. Learn to see the blessing that unfolds each time as you go about your daily life. There are many if we only bother to look. Be grateful!
2730,2019-04-04 11:43:25+00:00,muftimenk,"People with large egos can be difficult to deal with. Signs of a big ego include over confidence, blindness to personal flaws, focus on self over others &amp; difficulty seeing other points of view. Be wary of such people. They may not take kindly to advice. Pray for them instead!"
2731,2019-04-03 22:16:53+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s no doubt that life can be incredibly hard at times. The sick, terminally ill, sadness, oppression, adversity. The list goes on. But the one thing we have is our ability to help someone in their time of need. Let them know that someone cares. What a difference it makes!"
2732,2019-04-03 07:33:50+00:00,muftimenk,Your real test comes when you do the right thing even when it is difficult to do so; you’re able to keep a good attitude even though people are not treating you right and when you can go the extra mile while nobody is watching. That is true character! Respect!
2733,2019-04-02 23:17:41+00:00,muftimenk,We pray long &amp; hard to the Almighty for things or people we want in our lives. At times He doesn't give it to us. Not because we don't deserve it. Because it doesn't deserve us! If we knew the future &amp; what it holds we would never be dissatisfied with the Almighty’s Decree.
2734,2019-04-02 17:12:32+00:00,muftimenk,You’ll be in trouble when you take your eyes off your own path &amp; look over at someone else's. You’ll get sucked into comparing your life with others &amp; lose all sense of gratitude of the many blessings the Almighty has bestowed on you. Quick advice: don’t linger on social media!
2735,2019-04-02 07:18:05+00:00,muftimenk,"One of the biggest challenges we face today is that of pride &amp; arrogance. When we help someone, we feel good. But be wary of waiting for others to lavish praise on you. Don’t become big-headed. By all means get a pat on your back but the ultimate goal is to please the Almighty!"
2736,2019-04-01 22:52:10+00:00,muftimenk,Social media has many benefits but the quality of our life has become largely dependent on what we post online and how it compares to everyone else in our feed. Don’t let your value be attached to your online presence. It’s unhealthy. Appreciate life. Stop the comparison!
2737,2019-04-01 11:33:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people especially love it when they hear something that makes someone look bad. They seem to thrive on it &amp; can’t wait to spread it. Even though the temptation to gossip is powerful, you will always win when you choose NOT to engage in it. Make that commitment today."
2738,2019-03-31 23:23:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Occupy yourself with improving your own character &amp; conduct. Focus on your own faults rather than pointing fingers at others, which is what most of us are in the habit of doing. Aim to be a better version of yourself today than you were yesterday. The Almighty will help you!"
2739,2019-03-31 15:03:04+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t believe anyone who says that he has it all together; there’s no such thing. Every single one of us is fighting an unseen battle that is often hidden by a brave exterior. That's why it is so important to be compassionate. Always try &amp; put yourself in someone else’s shoes!
2740,2019-03-31 05:24:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When you give others a sincere compliment, words of encouragement or just a warm smile, you’re making their world a little better. You’re making them feel appreciated &amp; valuable. You’ll feel more fulfilled because you have done something to make someone else’s life better."
2741,2019-03-30 06:51:00+00:00,muftimenk,"We all worry. It’s human nature to do so. But it won’t change anything. The next time you’re tempted to worry, turn it around. Hand it over to the Almighty. Close your eyes and feel that sense of relief when you say, “ I may not understand what’s happening but I trust You!”"
2742,2019-03-30 00:31:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t think that the Almighty is unaware of every hurt and every unfair situation you’ve been through. He’s All-Knowing, All-Seeing. He will liberate you from all that has happened. Don’t keep it bottled up inside. Let it go and let Him take over. He is the best of Planners!"
2743,2019-03-29 11:52:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Cleanse your heart. Let go of grudges. What’s the point of holding them? Forgive and move on. When you forgive, the Almighty will increase your honour. Remember, nothing escapes Him. So break free from the clutches of grudges. You’ll feel the burden on your shoulders lighten!"
2744,2019-03-29 03:19:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, make us among those who when we know the truth, we’ll follow it &amp; when we see falsehood, we’ll avoid it. Grant us the ability to see right from wrong. We ask You to have Mercy on us, make things easy &amp; help us to do the things that will please You!"
2745,2019-03-28 18:16:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feed your fear. Feed your faith! When you feed your fear, you’re going the way Satan has mapped out for you; focusing on  fearful thoughts which keep you from moving forward. Instead, learn to trust the Almighty and His Plans. Get close to Him &amp; feel the peace."
2746,2019-03-28 03:36:29+00:00,muftimenk,One of the best remedies for tough times is to be patient. The trouble with most of us is we start complaining. We talk about our difficulties to anyone and everyone. Spend time instead remembering the Almighty. Get close to Him. He’s the Owner of all solutions to your problems!
2747,2019-03-27 20:15:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Start running your own race. Stop comparing yourself to others. If the Almighty wants you to have what others have, He will give it to you, if not now then at some stage later on. Be happy with His Decree. Show gratitude. If you’re grateful, He will surely grant you more."
2748,2019-03-27 06:31:16+00:00,muftimenk,A strong faith can keep us focused on the fact that the Almighty alone controls all destinies &amp; has power over all things. Remembering that fact when we’re being tested can help us overcome the pain and provide us with the hope &amp; energy to keep moving forward &amp; not give up!
2749,2019-03-27 00:19:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Betrayal hurts badly. It shatters the trust you had in others and leaves you feeling like you’ve done it all wrong. When a person close to you violates your trust, it calls everything into question and provides no easy answers. Put your trust in the Almighty to heal you."
2750,2019-03-26 11:38:19+00:00,muftimenk,"I'm deeply saddened by news of the deplorable #MaliMassacre where more than 130 villagers were brutally killed. We need to do more to spread peaceful coexistence on this earth which belongs to all of us. We must stand up &amp; say NO to violence, terror &amp; all killing. #ChildrenOfAdam"
2751,2019-03-26 08:10:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to listen. People just want to be heard. To feel that their voice matters. Give them a listening ear. Show them that in the chaos of this world, someone is concerned &amp; can empathize with them, free from judgment. Be that person for someone. Show your ability to care!"
2752,2019-03-25 16:23:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Hiding pain under a smile is not easy. It can be one of the hardest things to do. You do it when you care about others more than you do for yourself. But remember, a smile can hide so much; anxiety, fear, pain, sadness, tears. But they reflect one main thing. Inner strength!"
2753,2019-03-25 04:47:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Even when it seems like everything is going wrong, something is still going right. When we lose one thing, we gain another. There’s a blessing in all things, good and bad. The Almighty wants us to learn specific lessons before we can move on to the next level of spirituality!"
2754,2019-03-24 19:15:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Social media is making us forget how to interact with people in real-life. For some, posting what they want others to see helps them feel better about themselves, making them feel they’re connected to others. But technology isn’t life. Spend more time with people! Not devices!"
2755,2019-03-24 11:40:33+00:00,muftimenk,"A humble heart has no room for ego, pride or arrogance because it recognizes that all we have and all we are comes from the Almighty. We are nothing without Him. So learn to tread the earth humbly focusing on the Almighty &amp; helping others rather than concentrating on yourself!"
2756,2019-03-24 04:26:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t look down on those who are trying to get close to the Almighty, no matter how small their effort may seem to you. Not everyone is on the same spiritual level. Don’t use yourself as the yardstick. Everyone is worthy of help. Only the Almighty knows what’s in our hearts."
2757,2019-03-23 20:17:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Never feel unloved &amp; abandoned by your Maker. These are thoughts from Satan. The Almighty says don't despair. He tests you to reward you! So when things fall apart, it doesn't mean you're doomed. The Almighty's in full control. It may seem hopeless but He'll make it even better."
2758,2019-03-23 08:56:00+00:00,muftimenk,"If you don’t want to be disappointed, keep this in mind. Don’t expect much from people. Be prepared to have the most unexpected people let you down. Don’t get too attached to this life. Nothing lasts. Keep your faith in the Almighty. He’s the only One who has your back always!"
2759,2019-03-23 07:14:35+00:00,muftimenk,Don't allow the negativity of the world to depress you. Don't let your burdens drown you. Don’t think that your sins are the size of mountains &amp; there’s no hope! Just turn to the Almighty with sincere repentance. He loves those who repent. Peace will prevail in your heart!
2760,2019-03-22 21:54:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever we feel afraid or hopeless or we may not understand His Plan, just remember that His Plan is definitely better than all of ours! Pray that the Almighty grants us sincerity, humility, patience, gratitude and forgiveness. May we never ever lose hope in His Mercy!"
2761,2019-03-22 15:39:12+00:00,muftimenk,Don't allow the negativity of the world to depress you. Don't let your burdens drown you. Don’t think that your sins are the size of mountains &amp; there’s no hope! Just turn to the Almighty with sincere repentance. He loves those who repent. Peace will prevail in your heart!
2762,2019-03-22 05:30:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to grant peace to those who’ve lost loved ones. Surround them with those who’ll offer words of comfort. Remove the heaviness from their hearts. Help those who are feeling resentment, bitterness, or anger, not to look back but to press on!"
2763,2019-03-21 22:46:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Devastation caused by #CycloneIdai. #Mozambique #Zimbabwe #Malawi require urgent aid on a very large scale. Thousands are missing or have died. Villages, towns &amp; cities have been affected in the worst cyclone to hit this area in recent history. Please help via any legit charity."
2764,2019-03-21 16:22:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Big changes can be made in small steps. If you want the change to last, then you need more than a ""just do it"" mentality. It needs to be slowly cultivated till it becomes part of you. Then pray hard &amp; ask the Almighty to guide you. If anyone can help, it's the One who made you!"
2765,2019-03-21 04:57:45+00:00,muftimenk,We often hear people say the grass is greener on the other side. That’s not true. Stop comparing your lawn with someone else’s. The truth is it’s greener where you water it! It’s greener where you nurture it. Focus on the major things in life and you’ll see how it will thrive!
2766,2019-03-20 23:32:19+00:00,muftimenk,We live in uncertain times. The world is becoming a more dangerous place; nothing can be taken for granted. Much of the world seems to be in a state of bewildering confusion. Don’t neglect the link with our Maker. That’s the only way to keep our sanity during these times!
2767,2019-03-20 15:29:02+00:00,muftimenk,"You will learn more from the bad days than the good days because they’re designed to toughen you, provided you learn the life lessons attached to them. Some don’t &amp; they get stuck at a certain level because they refuse to or cannot see the whole picture yet! Pray for guidance!"
2768,2019-03-20 06:50:44+00:00,muftimenk,Everyone’s in search of contentment. It’s not easy to keep the peace in your heart. But you must find a way to do it. Plug in with the Almighty. Let Him take over when things are not within your control. You’ll see every sunrise holds more promise; every sunset holds more peace.
2769,2019-03-19 18:11:43+00:00,muftimenk,"When you encounter hate in any form, in speech or action, you must immediately denounce it, report it &amp; stop it. It’s your duty. It should not be tolerated whether in our everday lives, on main stream or social media. Say no to hate. Say no to violence! End the vicious cycle!"
2770,2019-03-19 06:48:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people just cannot communicate in a straightforward manner. They will use sarcasm as a defence mechanism, send mixed signals or act like nothing is wrong. If you cannot help such people, stay away from them. Life’s complicated enough without  having to second-guess others!"
2771,2019-03-18 22:54:58+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re allowed to disagree with others, state your opinion respectfully but NEVER get physical or violent. This quality makes us distinct from animals! So be civilised, listen to what others are saying but avoid knee-jerk reactions. It would save you from a whole lot of regret!"
2772,2019-03-18 11:01:50+00:00,muftimenk,Thinking of death will help you prepare for that meeting with your Creator. It will help you reflect on how you will appear before Him. Full of regret and shame or with a deep sense of happiness for having been dutiful. The choice is yours. Don't let this world trick you.
2773,2019-03-17 22:54:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Arrogance is being full of yourself, you're always right. You strut around like you know everything. Confidence is humble, quiet &amp; doesn't shout. You’re full of useful knowledge &amp; you share it in a manner that doesn’t make the other person feel ignorant! Know the difference!"
2774,2019-03-17 09:22:44+00:00,muftimenk,"In a world that’s trying to make you hate, judge &amp; not care about others, learn to be considerate &amp; compassionate. Be the bigger person. Be tolerant. Be the one who will go out of your way to help someone. Be the one showing kindness not just in bad times but all the time!"
2775,2019-03-16 22:42:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Being quiet and gentle doesn’t mean you’re weak. Such people show deep, inner strength that’s under control. It’s knowing when to speak and when to listen; when to take action and when to wait. Don’t underestimate such people. They walk the earth with the greatest strength!"
2776,2019-03-16 09:18:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When you want to give advice, do so in such a way that people will want to listen to you. Don’t be mean and hurtful. Don’t use harsh words and turn them off. Be genuine in wanting to correct their ways and help them get back on track. Your sincerity will long be remembered."
2777,2019-03-15 21:30:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty, we pray for those grieving. Those who are broken; with broken hearts &amp; broken lives. Comfort them. Bless them with healing. Change their circumstances. Help them make sense of all the chaos going on around them. Make them feel whole again. #NewZealand #HelloBrother"
2778,2019-03-15 04:29:12+00:00,muftimenk,"A very sad day! The #ChristChurchMosqueAttack has shocked us all. Such barbaric acts of terror are strongly condemned no matter who the victims or perpetrators are. We ALL need love, kindness &amp; respect. Let's pray for the victims, their loved ones, the nation &amp; humanity at large."
2779,2019-03-14 21:38:47+00:00,muftimenk,"The closer you get to the Almighty, the more you will find that He is even closer to you. Your trials &amp; difficulties become easier to handle. You gravitate towards Him at all times. You understand His Plan. He will touch the inner depths of your heart with a profound peace."
2780,2019-03-14 15:58:21+00:00,muftimenk,Why do we often feel like we can speak with authority on someone’s life? How can we when we’ve not experienced what the other person has; we’ve not walked in their shoes. We have the tendency to stereotype people and think like we know it all. The truth is we don’t!
2781,2019-03-13 22:59:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Challenges are a part of life; death of a loved one, a sudden illness, losing one’s job etc. If you want to make the most of your life, you need to learn how to push past whatever barriers are placed in your way. Keep going. Bear patience. Seek your strength from the Almighty."
2782,2019-03-13 14:00:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Why are you so worried over what people think about you? At the end of the day, it really doesn’t matter. Let them think what they will. You can’t control them. What others think about you will never change how the Almighty sees you. He made each one of us special!"
2783,2019-03-13 03:58:12+00:00,muftimenk,"When you speak about negative traits in others and spread untruths and vicious rumors about them, you’re sinning. Be wary. What they are and who they are - that’s none of your business anyway. Just stay away from this bad habit and you’re working your way towards Paradise!"
2784,2019-03-12 22:01:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop labelling people. We are conditioned to judge people based on their appearance, behavior, job etc. It happens subconsciously, we don’t even realize it. Labels limit others &amp; limit interaction. Even labels with good intentions, can create resentment &amp; the desire for revenge."
2785,2019-03-12 07:56:41+00:00,muftimenk,People will behave unjustly towards you at some stage in your life. Don’t fret &amp; get all upset. The truth will always out eventually. That should give you much comfort. Know that the Almighty is your best witness in all things. Keep your heart at peace no matter what’s going on.
2786,2019-03-11 22:26:23+00:00,muftimenk,"A heart does not turn cold unless it has been treated badly for a long while. Yet, some will still endure &amp; not show it. So cherish all those with good hearts in your life. Don’t take them for granted. Be compassionate. Learn to show them the gratitude they deserve!"
2787,2019-03-11 08:39:47+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t curse the crisis you’re facing. Every hardship has a silver lining; a blessing in disguise. Be patient with yourself and let the situation unfold. Do your best and let the Almighty do the rest. You’ll emerge stronger and better able to face whatever He sends your way.
2788,2019-03-10 22:00:09+00:00,muftimenk,"When should you stop praying for what you want? Never. For as long as you want it but remember, the same Almighty that opens doors; closes doors. You asked but you didn’t get it &amp; you get discouraged. But the Almighty knows what lies ahead. Trust Him!"
2789,2019-03-10 14:31:18+00:00,muftimenk,My heart goes out to all who lost  their lives in the #EthiopianAirlineCrash shortly after take-off from #AddisAbaba.  It’s indeed a sad day as I was on board another #EthiopianAirlines flight on my way home to Zimbabwe. May the Almighty comfort the families &amp; grant ease. Aameen.
2790,2019-03-10 06:04:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Couples need to work together to keep outside forces that may try to break them or their family. At times, this could be in the form of in-laws or the extended family. Hold your ground firmly &amp; respectfully. You’ll end up with longer lasting and happier married lives together!"
2791,2019-03-10 00:14:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Even the nicest people have their limits! Don’t push them too far; don’t try to reach those limits. Once the boundary is crossed, they’ll never be the same person you used to know and you’ll only have yourself to blame! If you can’t be kind, remain quiet. Don’t hurt people!"
2792,2019-03-09 16:30:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes people can be difficult to deal with; refusing to apologise for their mistake, always insisting they’re right. Don’t get upset. Having the right perspective can help lighten your load. If it won’t matter in the long run, let it go &amp; give it to the Almighty to sort out."
2793,2019-03-09 08:25:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Worry &amp; worship don’t go together. When you trust the Almighty, there’s no worry. Worry is a powerful tool used by Satan to deny us of what our Lord has planned for us. He will plant all sorts of ideas in our head. Don’t let Satan get the upper hand. Be on guard!"
2794,2019-03-08 18:01:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Detach yourself from that which is temporary. Do your best in everything but remember that the goal should always be to please the Almighty. Seek His help to purify your intent. As long as the link with Him is good, any hurdle along the way will become that much easier to handle."
2795,2019-03-08 07:23:09+00:00,muftimenk,"It's not your job to change someone. You can lead by example and show them the best behaviour, what’s expected of them, good character and conduct etc but remember at the end of the day, guidance comes from the Almighty. Your job is to spread love and goodness. Pray for them!"
2796,2019-03-07 23:15:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, make us steadfast in our prayers &amp; acts of worship done solely for You. Grant us humility &amp; a soft heart, never showing off or feeling that we’re more pious than the person next to us! Protect us from being arrogant &amp; may we never judge others!"
2797,2019-03-07 14:36:32+00:00,muftimenk,There are people who will never admit that they’re wrong. They will twist their words to suit the occasion; contradict themselves and make you look like the one who is wrong. Be wary of such people. Try not to argue with them. It’s worthless. Let the Almighty deal with them.
2798,2019-03-07 12:48:01+00:00,muftimenk,#WorldBookDay I've just launched Motivational Moments 2 in Dubai. #WorldBookDay2019 https://t.co/XMkZ0Nhxfg
2799,2019-03-07 07:21:29+00:00,muftimenk,Why do you feel the need to answer to your critics? You don’t have to. You don’t have to try and prove to people who you are. Your journey is yours alone. Remain steadfast. Honour Him. He will work things out for you in the end. Just remain calm and bear patience.
2800,2019-03-06 15:00:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Good or bad, everything in this life is a test. The Almighty tests us to see if we’re grateful. He tests us to see our reaction when His favours are withdrawn. When things go wrong, bear patience, trust Him. Don't give up hope. He will open doors and create opportunities!"
2801,2019-03-06 03:33:16+00:00,muftimenk,Be in the company of mature people. Those who admit they're wrong. Those who don't point fingers and blame others for their mistakes. Those who take responsibility for their actions. Those who don’t hesitate to apologise. These are people who will help you grow in life!
2802,2019-03-05 13:08:25+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t focus on the disappointments of your past. Learn from them and move on. We all make mistakes. Don’t beat yourself up so hard that you keep revisiting what’s done. The Almighty has forgiven you. Lift your spirits and look ahead  to the new things that He has in store!
2803,2019-03-04 21:02:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Feel the mountain of worries crumble &amp; your heart at ease when you supplicate to the Almighty. Such is the power of prayer. It’s the most powerful tool you have. Don’t waste it. If your beliefs &amp; confidence are strong enough, the impossible may become reality. Trust Him."
2804,2019-03-04 10:02:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Live life one day at a time. The problem with us is we tend to plan ahead so much as if we’re in full control of everything. Don’t miss the beauty of today wondering what tomorrow holds. Worry won’t add anything to your life, Be grateful the Almighty has given you another day!"
2805,2019-03-03 22:43:04+00:00,muftimenk,"For many of us, saying ""no"" is hard! We want others to like us, accept us; we want to meet their expectations &amp; please them. Learn to say ""no"" when you really mean ""no"" because it’s good for your well-being. We need time out; time for ourselves. Don’t feel guilty!"
2806,2019-03-03 14:14:05+00:00,muftimenk,Remember you’re not a burden. You’re not worthless. The Almighty made you and you’ve every right to be here. Don’t ever feel that the world would be better off without you. Everyone struggles. Everyone falls apart at some stage. ⁠ ⁠Do your best and leave the rest to Him.

2808,2019-03-03 05:40:49+00:00,muftimenk,"There are people out there who do very little and don’t bat an eyelid about taking credit for things they haven’t done. They’re happy to bask in the glory, like they deserve all the admiration. Remember, the Almighty is All-Seeeing. Rest easy knowing that your reward is with Him."
2809,2019-03-02 21:06:19+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let the trials &amp; pain that you’re experiencing make you unkind. Everyone has struggles. Nobody knows what the other person is going through. There's too much suffering in the world already. Bear patience. It may be bitter now but the end result will be sweeter!
2810,2019-03-02 08:47:17+00:00,muftimenk,The all new Motivational Moments 2 is now available in both the hard back and ebook versions. A compilation of the best of my tweets and quotes. Please visit https://t.co/wrJIM2rpOT https://t.co/2AlymZvL4r
2811,2019-03-02 06:25:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop constantly looking for a way to satisfy all your critics. Stop blaming yourself for all the wrong things. Stop telling yourself that you owe everything to everyone. Stop convincing yourself that you’re not good enough. As long as you’ve done your best, the Almighty knows!"
2812,2019-03-01 22:37:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Only the Almighty knows why you're in the state you are for so long.  But don’t fret because perhaps the delay in answering your prayer is better for you than you getting what you want, when you want it. Trust Him to get you out of the situation when the time is right."
2813,2019-03-01 12:19:54+00:00,muftimenk,"There’ll be good days and bad days. Sad things will happen in your life. Try not to be upset, learn to accept things &amp; take it in your stride. It’s all part of the Almighty’s Plan. So accept His Decree &amp; face everything with full confidence, knowing that He’s watching over you!"
2814,2019-02-28 22:48:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we thank You for giving us the strength when we felt like giving up. We’ve learnt not to panic  because we know You’re with us. Keep our hearts firm in faith, come what may. We fully trust everything that You have planned for us. Aameen."
2815,2019-02-28 14:06:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Many people are so busy spreading slander they hear about others that they do not even stop to consider whether it is true or false. Remember, if you hear something false about someone, defend him, speak up for him. The Almighty will defend you in this world and the next."
2816,2019-02-28 09:47:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t get upset and envious when the Almighty does something for others. What He has done for others, He can do for you. You need to understand His Plan. Celebrate the victory of others, be happy for them and He will grant you even more  just because you were patient!"
2817,2019-02-27 17:37:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Respect other people’s time. We often have a very selfish attitude towards time; we expect everyone to adjust their schedules around us but we won’t let anyone mess our day. Stop being self-centered and inflexible. Remember, what goes around, comes around Eventually!"
2818,2019-02-27 11:42:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Congratulations @MBuhari upon your reelection! May the Almighty protect you, continue to bless you &amp; guide you to the best decisions. May peace &amp; prosperity prevail. Aameen #Nigeria #Alhamdulillah https://t.co/b5MlZ33zky"
2819,2019-02-27 05:35:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, nothing lasts. Next year, you’re unlikely to be in the same place that you are now. Things happen, people change. That’s life. New happenings await you. New blessings. New trials. New opportunities. So always be aware &amp; keep your focus. Change is the only constant."
2820,2019-02-26 22:55:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember there’s no problem that cannot be solved or resolved. Life throws us curveballs on occasions and more often than not, what we worry about is not even important in the long term. Always seek guidance and strength from the One who has the answer to all our problems!"
2821,2019-02-26 05:14:40+00:00,muftimenk,"We often take for granted the people closest to us, especially our parents. May the Almighty always guide us to be respectful and kind to them, no matter what status, position and power we have achieved in life. Remember, how they brought us up when we were young."
2822,2019-02-25 16:03:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Thank the Almighty upon all conditions. It’s not just to do with wealth &amp; good things. Thank Him for guiding you &amp; keeping you steadfast. Thank Him for the increase in knowledge, for the lessons you’ve learnt from hardship. Do this each &amp; every day and He will grant you more!"
2823,2019-02-25 04:12:10+00:00,muftimenk,"When you stain your tongue with slander, backbiting and gossip, your spirituality goes down significantly. You may think you’re harming the other person but in actual fact, you’re harming yourself. So learn to hold your tongue because it has the power to make you or break you!"
2824,2019-02-24 18:02:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Be the bigger person. Let arguments go; not bigger in the sense of pride or knowledge, but to back down, be humble &amp; apologize if needed. Ask yourself before arguing: Who are you trying to prove yourself to? The Almighty knows what’s in your heart; so who else matters? Nobody!"
2825,2019-02-24 07:22:53+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty is the Most Wise. Whatever we face, it’s crucial that we always remember that He knows what’s best for us. Though we shy away from facing our worries &amp; fears, it may be that we hate a thing that’s good for us &amp; desire something that can only lead to our destruction."
2826,2019-02-23 16:35:05+00:00,muftimenk,"As humans, we become emotional at times regarding matters that are close to our hearts. Seek comfort through patience and prayer. The Almighty will strengthen us, protect us and grant us true inner peace."
2827,2019-02-22 22:57:45+00:00,muftimenk,"When those we trusted let us down, the sadness is even more and can be very painful. Learn not to expect too much from anyone. Trust the Almighty and depend on Him always. Those closest to us can hurt us the most. Don't drop your guard. The Almighty Alone will heal us."
2828,2019-02-22 15:57:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Know that you’ll never fully understand everything that’s going on in your life. Why things happen the way they do. If you try to figure it all out, you’ll end up getting frustrated. Leave it to the All-Knowing Almighty. That’s His job. Your job is to trust Him. Without a doubt!"
2829,2019-02-22 04:15:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, help us to often think of the day we’ll be returning to You. Take us when You are totally pleased with us. Help us understand that any delay would give us a chance to further prepare ourselves for the long-awaited meeting with You. Grant us ease!"
2830,2019-02-21 17:14:05+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will test your character. He is going to see if your faith is real, if you’re patient enough! The test will show if you can handle the blessings, the influence, the success &amp; failure, the good &amp; bad. He’ll determine if you’re unwavering in faith. He’s the best Judge!"
2831,2019-02-21 06:25:26+00:00,muftimenk,Just because you want peace around you doesn’t mean agreeing with everyone all the time. You have to stand your ground and believe what you believe. But don’t shove your thoughts and beliefs down someone’s throat. Sometimes you have to agree to disagree. Be respectful.
2832,2019-02-20 15:39:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of the company you keep. They could be the cause of your unhappiness or even downfall. If they’re overly focused on appearance, trappings of this word &amp; social media, you could slowly be drawing yourself away from what should be your focus in life, the Almighty."
2833,2019-02-20 05:14:07+00:00,muftimenk,"When you find the need to lie about others, know that it is a definite sign of their success &amp; your failure. You have a diseased heart if you run others down like that. Sooner or later, it will all come back to you. Don’t rob others of what is theirs. The Almighty’s All-Seeing."
2834,2019-02-19 17:53:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Gossip is like something you’re craving for. You say you don’t like it, but when someone tells you a juicy piece of news, you can’t resist it. It’s the work of Satan. Be wary of this pitfall; when you develop an interest &amp; suddenly want to know what you don’t know about others!"
2835,2019-02-19 10:06:12+00:00,muftimenk,Being successful &amp; having everything doesn’t define your self-worth. Being positive is one of the main things you need for survival. The ability to see the glass half full rather than half empty is the key to being happy &amp; appreciating where you are in life. Thank Him always!
2836,2019-02-19 00:08:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you feel like you’re running around doing too much for this world, leaving little time for your Hereafter? You’re not alone. It’s easy to get sucked into one thing after another; there seems to be no end. Learn to pause &amp; take stock of your life before it's too late."
2837,2019-02-18 08:13:35+00:00,muftimenk,Just because you took longer than others doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Don’t compare your journey to those around you. You’ll end up disappointed &amp; disillusioned. Tread your path the best way you can. Focus on the route ahead. Don’t be distracted!
2838,2019-02-17 14:12:56+00:00,muftimenk,You may not be where you want to be in life but thank the Almighty that you’re not where you used to be. His Plan is always the best. Don’t doubt that. Don’t let others humiliate you with things from your past. Repent sincerely and move on. Know that He has forgiven you.
2839,2019-02-17 02:37:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry when things don’t work out. If you’ve tried your best &amp; it doesn’t work then let it go. Free yourself from worries &amp; pain by relying only on the Almighty. Just be patient, your time is yet to come. The Almighty knows your struggles. He hears your prayers!"
2840,2019-02-16 09:57:40+00:00,muftimenk,"In this make believe world of social media, people will only show you what they want you to see. Remember, everyone has a chapter in their lives where they don’t read out loud. So don’t be fooled by the “perfect front” that you often see. You’d be foolish to believe all that."
2841,2019-02-15 23:47:26+00:00,muftimenk,We all have problems that we believe will never be solved because it has been been too long. We feel bogged down by our own shortcomings. We begin to accept that this is how it's always going to be. But know that the Almighty doesn’t give up on you just because you’ve given up!
2842,2019-02-15 10:07:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray that you have Mercy on us &amp; grant us ease. May You comfort all those who are suffering and bring on their recovery. We know there is no cure but Your cure. Heal our heart &amp; purify our soul so we can feel a strong attachment to You. Aameen."

You’ll feel a sense of self worth that you’re actually helping someone &amp; making a difference. See how your life changes!"
2844,2019-02-14 08:08:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Think positive thoughts as far as possible. Don’t think of who offended you, who betrayed you, who took you for granted &amp; what didn’t work out. Such things are bound to happen in life. Instead, think of the goodness the Almighty has bestowed on you and how fortunate you are!"
2845,2019-02-13 21:49:02+00:00,muftimenk,Sometimes what is not said is the more powerful message. But we’re too busy speaking our minds that we miss the clues. The one who says she’s fine but has eyes full of tears. The one who smiles because she’s too sad to cry. Even the strongest have their breaking points. Be kind
2846,2019-02-13 07:51:14+00:00,muftimenk,"No one likes pain. In fact, most try to avoid it at all costs. But remember that pain is part of life. In fact, pain can strengthen your spiritual journey. It can bring you closer to the Almighty. Pain can also bring focus and reveal your true self and your purpose in life!"
2847,2019-02-12 19:41:10+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with us is the minute we encounter a problem, we have to tell others about it.  Make it a habit to confide in the Almighty first before sharing it with anyone else. Remember, He knows everything there is to know about you and He already has a solution for you!"
2848,2019-02-12 09:28:43+00:00,muftimenk,"No one knows what the future  holds but what we do know is the Almighty has a plan for each one of us. So no matter how bad the past has been, how many times we fell and picked ourselves up, all that matters is we’re trying to get close to Him. None of this will ever be wasted!"
2849,2019-02-11 22:19:33+00:00,muftimenk,We're all scarred in one way or another. The scars you get in life are proof of your inner strength. It shows how you lived your life! They are there to strengthen you; to remind you that these are among the Almighty’s biggest tests &amp; how you survived with beautiful patience!
2850,2019-02-10 23:52:57+00:00,muftimenk,"The more we try to get close to the Almighty, the harder Satan will work to push us away. He will create confusion &amp; fear; anxiety, panic or worry over something we can't control or even distinguish. It’s all part of his plan and you need to be aware. Seek strength from Him!"
2851,2019-02-10 10:18:13+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, we want the best of everything. We want success, to be loved, popular, rich, healthy, intelligent etc. We don’t want to be sad, sick, poor, in pain, hurt etc. But remember, every step of the way, the Almighty is in control! He knows you better than you know yourself!"
2852,2019-02-09 18:35:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to be strong; unwavering in faith. You have to face whatever the Almighty has decreed head on. Seek His help &amp; protection always. Don’t worry about what others say. At the end of your life, you’re not going to answer to people. It’ll just be between you &amp; the Almighty!"
2853,2019-02-09 05:56:34+00:00,muftimenk,"In a world where there’s so much fake, find it in your heart to be yourself. Be you. Don’t be a hypocrite. No apologies. Say no when you don’t want something. Don’t be forced into saying yes. Be honest. Be authentic. Don’t be part of anything fake. Your heart will be at peace!"
2854,2019-02-08 22:06:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Perhaps you’re not where you think you should be, given your age, because the Almighty is teaching you that you can’t keep living your life according to what society dictates. Let go of expectations. Understand His Plan. Things will happen when He decides they will happen!"

They might ridicule you, spread rumours about you or even spew harsh words. Don’t worry. Focus on what’s right &amp; keep going. The Almighty’s on your side."
2856,2019-02-08 04:33:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, protect us from being leaking buckets; those who follow up their good deeds with bad ones. May we not be among those who pray, fast &amp; give charity but curse, swear, gossip &amp; backbite without batting an eyelid. Keep us mindful of such behaviour."
2857,2019-02-07 23:10:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because someone isn’t doing things the way you would be doing them, doesn’t necessarily mean they're wrong. Understand that we are made to think differently. Accommodate someone else’s perspective. Let us learn to appreciate people for who the Almighty has made them to be."
2858,2019-02-07 13:03:52+00:00,muftimenk,You guessed it... https://t.co/bmewJKo31I
2859,2019-02-07 04:54:55+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty is making you wait perhaps because the more you wait, the more you’ll appreciate what you’re going to get. Maybe He just doesn’t want you to be ungrateful. He wants you to value the gifts He’s going to send you &amp; He’ll do that only when He knows you’re ready!"
2860,2019-02-06 11:33:20+00:00,muftimenk,Choose your battles wisely. Not all are worth fighting. Walk away from those who disrespect you by lying. The best response to such people is no response at all. There’s no need for any confrontation because it would usually lead to more lies. Leave it be. The Almighty knows!
2861,2019-02-05 17:48:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t fret over missed opportunities &amp; closed doors. Instead, pause &amp; think. It’s the Almighty’s way of protecting us from the pain &amp; anguish not meant for us. Had He allowed it, we would have been left broken &amp; in total despair! Trust the judgment of the Best Planner always!"
2862,2019-02-04 21:48:58+00:00,muftimenk,"As humans, even the strongest among us gets tired at times. But that’s where patience, prayer &amp; positivity play a big role. Without any of that, you’d probably have called it quits. Keep your strength &amp; hope in the Almighty. He will reward those with beautiful patience!"
2863,2019-02-04 14:41:07+00:00,muftimenk,"We keep asking the Almighty to change our situation. But have we thought real hard about this? He puts us in that particular situation to change us. The way we behave, the way we view things, our perspectives, our mindset. The trials are meant to strengthen us not weaken us!"
2864,2019-02-04 04:08:12+00:00,muftimenk,"One of the hardest things must be when everyone out there’s getting what you want &amp; you’re waiting for your turn. It’s a test of your patience. Your time will come. If it’s good for you, you’ll get it eventually. If not, the Almighty will give you what’s even better! Trust Him!"
2865,2019-02-03 21:07:08+00:00,muftimenk,"When you regret the sins you’ve committed, feel sad for having committed them and feel pain when you remember them, then these are signs of sincere repentance. However, after repenting, Satan will cause you to doubt the Almighty’s Mercy. Don’t despair. Don’t fall for it!"
2866,2019-02-03 09:11:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to let go of the past. Release what doesn’t make sense. Don’t keep them in your heart and burden yourself. Don’t let it cloud your judgement, replaying the scenes many times over. Choose to forgive. Trust the Almighty. He will heal you &amp; make you whole again."
2867,2019-02-02 20:27:53+00:00,muftimenk,You want to change things? Shift your mindset. Most things will never change until your mind does! Embrace positivity. Don’t let Satan or anyone mess with your mind. Keep your focus on your goal &amp; work at it. The Almighty never said it’d be easy but promised it’d be worth it!
2868,2019-02-02 05:49:27+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want change, do something about it. Change requires action. Mere talk will get you nowhere. People will have lofty ideals about what they want to change, yet do nothing to achieve it. If you’re sincere about change, seek the Almighty’s help. He will pave the way for you."
2869,2019-02-01 22:57:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, Satan always has a plot but the Almighty has a Plan. Incline your heart towards His Plan &amp; you’ll be assured of success. It may not happen today or tomorrow because life is a journey that must be traveled no matter what happens along the way. Seek His help &amp; trust Him"
2870,2019-02-01 12:41:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Man is selfish by nature. So don’t fret if the good you do is not reciprocated or acknowledged. Don’t feel disheartened although it’s natural to feel that way. Remember, the Angels are recording every single deed, no matter how small! And your reward is with the Almighty!"
2871,2019-01-31 21:49:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Those who are against you love to cause confusion. No matter how you clarify things, they won’t be satisfied. The truth will offend them. So be it. Don’t look for the approval of others. Only the Almighty’s approval matters.  What’s for you will be yours. No one can stop it!"
2872,2019-01-31 13:46:46+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t attach your heart to those who lead a sinful life for you might one day find yourself in deep regret. It’s so important to choose your friends wisely because knowingly or unknowingly they can make a huge difference to your life. Take heed!
2873,2019-01-31 04:49:43+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s no room for arrogance in your heart. Don’t ever feel the need to look down on someone, not for anything that the Almighty has bestowed on you; wealth, status, power, children, good looks etc. Remember the Lord of the Worlds can change your fortune in the blink of an eye"
2874,2019-01-30 17:26:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t put your life on hold while waiting for something from the Almighty. You can’t afford to waste time. Your worship never stops. Keep going. Keep knocking on His door. When He thinks it’s time, everything will fall into place &amp; you’ll be overwhelmed. You have to trust Him!"
2875,2019-01-30 10:16:12+00:00,muftimenk,Never doubt what the Almighty can do. The Lord of the Worlds can work miracles and make the impossible possible! He can suddenly change things and move people out of your life. He can suddenly open doors you never dreamed would open. All you have to do is to trust Him!
2876,2019-01-29 19:20:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Today, we can’t seem to have a decent debate without getting angry. We’re so caught up with putting our points across &amp; we forget to listen to the other side. Always be fair, remain calm, respectful &amp; committed to let the other party have their say. It’s good ethics!"
2877,2019-01-29 06:22:09+00:00,muftimenk,"When you want to correct others, you have to do it gently without being distasteful. Sometimes when you give advice, people become more aggressive &amp; even worse off than they were before you gave them advice because of the way you did it. Choose the kindest words and be sincere!"
2878,2019-01-28 17:44:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to restrain your anger because if you don’t, you’ll end up insulting, cursing, swearing &amp;  hitting someone. Anger leads to other evil. So keep your tongue busy with the remembrance of the Almighty. This brings peace to the heart. Don’t use your tongue to hurt other people."
2879,2019-01-28 08:06:17+00:00,muftimenk,"We all encounter storms in life. It happens for a reason. To test you, teach you, bring you closer to the Almighty, strengthen you, show who’s in charge of your life, remind you that everyone will be tested to varying degrees. You’re not the only one experiencing it. Be patient"
2880,2019-01-27 17:09:39+00:00,muftimenk,"If you find yourself being tested again and again even though you’re doing all that the Almighty has asked of you, know that your trials are a blessing not a punishment. He loves you and sends the toughest tests to his best soldiers. Endure with beautiful patience."
2881,2019-01-27 07:51:03+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to celebrate other people's success even before you begin to experience yours. Be happy for them. Don’t begrudge them. You can ask the Almighty to bless you with the same. But never be mean and wish ill upon them. A genuine heart is a great blessing. Not many have it!
2882,2019-01-26 15:42:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop judging and questioning someone's intention. So much goodwill is lost when we do that. Instead, be honest and try to empathise with people. Always think good thoughts and follow through with good actions. It makes for a much more pleasant life all round!"
2883,2019-01-26 03:03:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Why are you feeling hopeless and on the brink of giving up? The Almighty gives hope for every disappointment, courage for every fear and strength for every weakness! That should give you so much to live for; to carry on and persevere knowing that He’s watching over you always!"
2884,2019-01-25 17:19:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do, don’t fall into this trap. Don’t try to paint an awful picture of someone else in order to paint a perfect picture of yourself. It will come back to haunt you and it won’t be a beautiful sight. Remember, what goes around comes around. Take heed!"
2885,2019-01-25 04:12:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, remove our attachment to worldly things. Instead, make our hearts attached to You &amp; make us love You more. Keep our hearts pure &amp; always obedient in Your Path, no matter what’s going on in our lives. It’s the only way to have peace in our hearts."
2886,2019-01-24 17:19:26+00:00,muftimenk,One of the biggest flaws in humans is pretending to be blind to their own shortcomings but they’re the first to jump down someone's throat when others make a mistake. Learn to be more self-critical instead of pointing fingers. Leave the judging to the fairest Judge of all!
2887,2019-01-24 07:02:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t give up when you encounter the slightest problem. True determination is not for the faint-hearted. It is an invisible strength of endurance that allows you stay in an uncomfortable place. Work hard at whatever you want to achieve. Above all, seek the Almighty’s help!"
2888,2019-01-24 00:05:28+00:00,muftimenk,Some love being controversial &amp; argumentative just to get recognition in life. They love making headlines &amp; being in the limelight. Be careful. Think of the consequences when you’re alone in your grave or worse having to defend yourself before your Creator on Judgement Day!
2889,2019-01-23 13:00:57+00:00,muftimenk,"It is human nature to always want the best ‘view’ when we’re in a beautiful place. That’s what we’ll have in Paradise. Sadly, many of us have become distracted &amp;. absorbed by this temporary world &amp; forgotten our purpose &amp; goals for our Hereafter. Strive to get back on track!"
2890,2019-01-22 22:42:39+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with this life is we have so many conveniences at our fingertips. It’s a life of instant gratification. Always remember that with the Almighty, things work according to His time. So be patient and persevere just because it’s taking a lot longer than you expected."
2891,2019-01-22 08:53:54+00:00,muftimenk,Embrace the pain in your life. It’s a necessary part of your growth. It strengthens you. It deepens your faith. It brings you closer to the Almighty. It builds character. It teaches you to worship instead of worry. It’s never easy but the rewards are great. Bear patience!
2892,2019-01-21 16:53:52+00:00,muftimenk,"They say old habits die hard. Do not go back to your old ways, no matter what you’re experiencing in life. Toxic habits, negative people &amp; negative energy always tend to come back when you are doing better in life. Satan will see to that. Don’t fall into the trap. Stay focused!"
2893,2019-01-20 22:38:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of those who lie to make themselves feel good. They have an ego problem. They discredit others out of jealousy, always wanting to be one up &amp; to show the world that they’re the good ones. It won’t last. The truth will out. It will lead to their own downfall eventually!"
2894,2019-01-20 03:33:01+00:00,muftimenk,Life is full of trickery &amp; distractions. It will tempt us in more ways than one. It’s inevitable. Because we live in a world that’s filled to the brim with temptations &amp; addictions that are intended to lead us far away from the Almighty. Be disciplined enough to resist it!
2895,2019-01-19 22:13:13+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s a common misconception among many who think they need to turn their lives around before they can start praying and getting closer to the Almighty. Know that this is a trick of Satan. Don’t fall for it. No matter what’s going on in your life, pray! He’s waiting for you."
2896,2019-01-19 07:34:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When you stop worrying about who likes you and who doesn't, that's the start of something good. You want to be respected for who you are. Don't worry about what others think. Don’t worry about impressing people. Live to please the Almighty. Your reward is with Him!"
2897,2019-01-18 12:57:00+00:00,muftimenk,"""You're judged by how you treat others. So work on it."" #muftimenk #motivationalmoments #muslimcentral #respectall #BuildingBridges #lovepreacher https://t.co/DvHA6cHp53"
2898,2019-01-18 08:27:22+00:00,muftimenk,Pray for those you love. Pray for those who hate you. Pray for those who try to harm you. Why? Because prayer is the most precious gift you can give someone and a good prayer may soften their heart and lead them to be guided. Imagine the rewards that await you! Keep praying!
2899,2019-01-18 00:07:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, help us become better people today than we were yesterday. Help us win the fight between desire &amp; discipline so we may get closer to You. Help us let go of negative people so we may grow into positive, grateful people with good character &amp; conduct"
2900,2019-01-17 13:53:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay away from those who constantly ask and gossip about others as well as those who love to discuss people's flaws. These are traits disliked greatly by the Almighty. Try advising such people privately and show them more meaningful activities. Remember, choose friends wisely!"
2901,2019-01-17 07:05:42+00:00,muftimenk,Be kind to people. Never think you're better than others. The trouble with those who appear pious is that they think they’re on a higher level &amp; scoff at everyone else who may seem less pious! It’s a terrible trait to have. Don’t be hard on others. Piety comes with gentleness.
2902,2019-01-16 20:24:16+00:00,muftimenk,It’s easy to wallow in self pity and look at everything that’s wrong in your life. Try this instead. Pray to the Almighty for a fresh start in any area of your life. Let go of that which is bad for your heart. Start anew. Receive the blessings!
2903,2019-01-15 15:21:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Your journey will often be distracted by people’s opinions. Don’t let it consume you. Be honest with yourself. Purify your intention. It makes it easier for you to handle what others think. Besides, it’s not your reputation the Almighty is after. He looks at your heart!"
2904,2019-01-15 03:44:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember that sinning is a choice. You have been given the faculty to tell right from wrong. So use that choice for your own good.  Each time you’re tempted to do wrong but choose to do the right thing, you grow. That’s how you develop a closer link with the Almighty."
2905,2019-01-14 19:59:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Well done young Zayd Menk for making it to the Great Big Story! Absolutely awesome! Proud of you!

2906,2019-01-14 14:48:07+00:00,muftimenk,"In our bid to solve problems, we sometimes create even bigger problems. Repairing a burst pipe requires glue. Using a drill will destroy whatever remains of the pipe. Be wary. In a fit of rage, we may cause greater loss to ourselves instead of resolving the issue we’re facing."
2907,2019-01-14 08:33:23+00:00,muftimenk,"There’s no way you can see &amp; correct your own sins &amp; weaknesses, if you’re focused on criticizing others. Remember, you’re accountable for all your actions. The Almighty will ask you about what you’ve done, not about what others have done. Save yourself by focusing on yourself."
2908,2019-01-13 21:54:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Many think that marriage is magical and that love can change all your woes. When it fades or leaves, at least from time to time, they think that means the marriage should end. Wrong! Marriages take work. They don’t happen by magic and don’t stay alive without investing in them!"
2909,2019-01-13 09:45:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Have the courage to walk away from the drama &amp; people who create it around you. It’s most often about them &amp; not you. Surround yourself with those who support you &amp; believe in you. Focus on the positive. Love those who treat you well, pray for the ones who don't! They need it!"
2910,2019-01-12 21:31:54+00:00,muftimenk,The evil eye is real and should not be taken lightly. Most people are negligent in protecting themselves and do not worry about showing off their blessings; posting every detail of their life on social media. Know that not everyone who sees your story will be happy for you!
2911,2019-01-12 06:13:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful about giving your heart fully to someone else other than the Almighty. Everyone can hurt you but only He can heal you. So be wise, have realistic expectations and protect your heart as best you can from those who are too quick to profess their love for you."
2912,2019-01-11 16:36:09+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in a world where we want things immediately. But, all around us, the Almighty teaches us a profound lesson that everything is a process and takes time. You will not always see the fruits of your labour right away. Maybe not even in your lifetime. Don’t get discouraged."
2913,2019-01-11 08:42:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t think that you can make yourself happy by bringing misery to other people. You can’t. It doesn’t work that way. The Almighty is fully aware and He knows what’s going on. If you want happiness, make others happy and you’ll feel the ripple effect of that happiness as well!"
2914,2019-01-11 00:17:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray for those who are on the verge of losing hope &amp; broken. Those who are trying to shake off their past mistakes &amp; return to You. Those who cry alone at night while the world sleeps. Comfort them. Grant them ease &amp; healing. Aameen."
2915,2019-01-10 17:15:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Reset, recharge and revitalize each time you feel your faith weakening. Satan will keep planting thoughts in your head. Stay focused and ignore the whispering. Remember, with the Almighty you can have a reset anytime you need one."
2916,2019-01-10 06:56:13+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be sad to the extent that we think nobody could possibly be in a worse situation than what we’re facing now. That’s not true. Always look at those who are in far worse situations than ourselves when we’re feeling hopeless and depressed.
2917,2019-01-09 15:09:34+00:00,muftimenk,"The world will teach you to never be satisfied; always wanting more. It’s one of the biggest traps of Satan. It’s so widespread that people have forgotten to appreciate what they have. Always uneasy, thinking of the next thing even before they can appreciate what they have!"
2918,2019-01-09 09:04:09+00:00,muftimenk,Worried. Stressed. Frustrated. Depressed. The solution to all that can be found in prayer. In prostration. Seek the Almighty and you’ll find the greatest comfort. That’s the best antidote you need for stressed souls and aching hearts. You only have to reach out to Him.
2919,2019-01-08 21:48:23+00:00,muftimenk,"It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been going in the wrong direction, all it takes is one move, one jolt and the Almighty can turn you around again. Heed the signs. Trust Him completely and your heart will be at ease. He is the ultimate guide!"
2920,2019-01-08 14:26:06+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty can fix anything and everything that’s broken. No matter how bad it is, He can put it back together; even if it’s shattered into smithereens. Don’t let your life problems overwhelm you. He can mend it no matter how impossible you think it is!"
2921,2019-01-07 22:28:50+00:00,muftimenk,Many are prone to overthinking. They carry on running conversations inside their heads all day. Thoughts about one situation overlap thoughts about another &amp; they return to them over &amp; over again. Stop feeding your mind negative thoughts &amp; self doubt. It’s the act of Satan.
2922,2019-01-07 09:35:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Social media trolls take it upon themselves to make negative, derogatory &amp; even abusive comments about everything you say or do. They are acknowledging the impact you have on others &amp; are jealous of the good you do. Ignore them &amp; their agenda. Smile &amp; carry on your good work!"
2923,2019-01-06 18:48:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remember, with the Almighty, nothing is impossible. Change your mindset and start becoming optimistic and confident when you ask Him for whatever you want. Stop being pessimistic and think of the worst. Don’t pay lip service and say you trust Him. Put it into practice."
2924,2019-01-06 04:46:19+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re constantly on edge, tense and irritable, always complaining about the slightest thing, low on tolerance and upset with people around you, be wary. These are signs of weak faith. Learn to cultivate more patience and tolerance in your life."
2925,2019-01-05 20:39:08+00:00,muftimenk,"When we feel rejected, misunderstood  and let down by people, it’s the Almighty teaching us a valuable lesson. Remember the wisdom in all that. When you depend on others, expect to be let down. That’s the nature of humans. We should really be depending on Him for everything!"
2926,2019-01-05 09:53:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't judge others just because you've heard what they've done. Always give people a chance to prove themselves. It’s the least you can do and not have preconceived ideas planted in your mind. Remember, the Almighty can move hearts. He guides whom He wills anytime!"
2927,2019-01-05 04:22:58+00:00,muftimenk,So your friend got something you've been asking the Almighty for a long while. There's no need to be jealous. That's one of the biggest tests of faith. What is yours will get to you sooner or later. Don’t let grudge and hatred build in your heart over material possessions!
2928,2019-01-04 16:41:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Failure is something we’ve all experienced. Just because you occasionally fall to the ground does not mean you are defeated. But if you stay down &amp; don’t get back up, life will keep pushing you to the ground. Your setbacks are a test from the Almighty. Pick yourself up. Move on!"
2929,2019-01-04 08:56:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty On this blessed day, grant us the strength to purify our hearts from spiritual sins like greed, malice, envy, arrogance, hatred and the likes. Help us to repent sincerely each time we sin. Draw us closer to You and keep our hearts light and beautiful! Aameen."
2930,2019-01-03 23:17:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When life gets hard it’s easy to think of the worst &amp; stop dreaming of good things because it feels like they are unachievable. You’ll get days when you want to quit. But firm faith &amp; the belief that after hardship, there’ll be ease, should see you through your journey!"
2931,2019-01-03 20:31:53+00:00,muftimenk,"He is never angry or fed up of your supplication or call upon Him. The tweet is about never giving up on supplication. Don't think that the Almighty gets angry at your call so he won't hear you. However, we firmly believe in the qualities of anger and happiness of the Almighty."
2932,2019-01-03 17:27:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare your own progress in life. How you were before to how you are today; your former self to your present self. If you have made progress and you’re doing your best to stay on the straight path, you’re on the right track! Keep going."
2933,2019-01-03 02:25:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Doing the right thing when it’s difficult is not an easy task. It requires firm faith &amp; strong conviction. But you will reap benefits, blessings &amp; rewards from the Almighty; not just in this life, but the Hereafter as well. So when the going gets tough, strive even harder!"
2934,2019-01-02 15:56:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Every pain, every stress, every hardship that you’re going through won’t matter one day. That one day when everything stops and all that matters is how you’ve lived your life. So don’t wait till you’re older to get close to the Almighty. Nobody is promised tomorrow. Start now!"
2935,2019-01-02 09:03:35+00:00,muftimenk,"When you wake each day, be sure to thank the Almighty. Thank Him for giving you another go at life. You’d have nothing without Him. The air you breathe, the heart that beats, the blood flowing through your veins are all gifts from Him. Learn to shut negativity out. Be grateful!"
2936,2019-01-01 19:52:34+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want change, it’s best to do it in small steps. Giant leaps may not last. Remember, nothing is easy. No quick fix solutions. Work at it &amp; seek help from the Almighty.  Ask Him to guide you. Rely on Him because if there’s anyone who can help you, it's the One who made you"
2937,2019-01-01 09:06:45+00:00,muftimenk,It’s easy to think the worst of something. In fact. it comes naturally to many. To think the best requires faith. Especially when things look bleak. That’s the Almighty testing you to see how you’ll respond. Do you crumble &amp; throw in the towel or do you press on and trust Him?
2938,2019-01-01 00:34:19+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age where people are conditioned to look ‘perfect’, have the courage to be yourself; to be real and not fake things about yourself just to fit into an image. Be authentic, be sincere and the Almighty will open doors for you which you never imagined before."
2939,2018-12-31 08:56:37+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t dislike people just because you’ve heard something bad about them. Always give them the benefit of the doubt. Would you like others to do that to you? Surely you don’t want to be condemned by those you’ve not even met? Be fair. The Almighty loves those who are fair-minded
2940,2018-12-31 01:21:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When you supplicate to the Almighty, never for a moment think that He might be tired of listening to you. He loves it when you ask Him. He is never angry or fed up. He knows how much you need Him. He is ever ready to listen. Nothing is impossible for Him. So keep asking."
2941,2018-12-30 16:19:10+00:00,muftimenk,"When we do good things, most of the time, we’re hoping to get some recognition and appreciation from others. But if we purify our intention and do something solely for the sake of the Almighty, the rewards are beyond our imagination. No matter how small the deed, He knows!"
2942,2018-12-30 00:01:01+00:00,muftimenk,Think good thoughts. Be good &amp; do good. But this may be too difficult for many today who have a holier-than-thou  mentality &amp; are constantly judging others. Don’t forget that the person you looked down on may be in Paradise before you if the Almighty wills.
2943,2018-12-29 09:50:57+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty’s attention to detail is like no other! He is perfection. So why should you worry when you have a Master Planner for your life? He’s bestowed you with so much goodness. Do your part and your Provider will give you what it takes to build a good life!
2944,2018-12-28 21:53:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep praying for patience &amp; contentment. We live in such a materialistic world that it can be hard to resist stuff you see around you. Don’t be tempted to have the latest in everything; fashion, electronic gadgets, computers &amp; cars. Spend that money on a good cause instead!"
2945,2018-12-28 13:32:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Feed your faith constantly by remembering the Almighty. Focus on the good He has bestowed on you and be ever grateful. When you live a life of gratitude, you see things which a negative mind can’t. Thank Him for everything and He will grant you more!"
2946,2018-12-28 10:09:45+00:00,muftimenk,"I understand the context of these peaceful words but I can't imagine what would happen if someone of another faith repeated them. At times, we need to be reminded how to word things in a better way; for example: ...grows with the sacrifice of men &amp; women who give their lives... https://t.co/vjsL0lr95V"
2947,2018-12-28 07:43:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, grant ease to those who are stressed out by the demands of this world as life is always throwing up new challenges and difficulties. Relieve them from the weight of their worries and stress. Let peace dwell in their hearts and minds. Aameen."
2948,2018-12-27 21:42:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Accept the fact that people will come &amp; go in your life. The Almighty will send those you’d never thought you’d meet. He’ll take away people you never thought you’d lose. It’s all part of His Plan &amp; the lessons He wants you to learn. Remember, what’s meant for you will be yours"
2949,2018-12-27 14:12:57+00:00,muftimenk,"As you go about spreading  goodness &amp; lending a hand to others, remember that you’re just as important as other people. Learn to say ""no"" when your obligations &amp; responsibilities get too much. Don’t spread yourself so thin that you’ll end up no good for yourself or anyone else!"
2950,2018-12-27 05:28:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Thank the Almighty for closed doors in our lives. They are just as valuable as open doors. They teach us and guide us what’s not meant for us. As a result, we become stronger. Don’t think that He’s withholding things from us. It’s always done with His perfect wisdom."
2951,2018-12-26 18:01:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remind yourself that this life is short. It’s like a visa given to you for a temporary stay. So keep the Hereafter in mind &amp; learn to do things which will add value to your life. Choose virtuous, righteous people as friends; those who will keep you on the straight path!"
2952,2018-12-26 09:33:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to take things in your stride. Ups &amp; downs happen to everyone. Remember, we'll all experience pain, hardship, heartache, disappointment, betrayal, loss, fear, loneliness, grief &amp; suffering. It’s your ability to react to them correctly that will determine your life story."
2953,2018-12-25 22:53:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Patience is a quality of the heart. The more patient you are, the better person you become. An effective way to strengthen our patience is through the link with our Creator. Don't lose that link. Exercise patience for His sake and He won’t let you down in your darkest moments."
2954,2018-12-25 15:41:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn not to get upset when people say bad things about you. Don’t waste your energy with negative emotions. They will only drain you. Remember, people won’t bother about those who are’nt making an impact in life! Continue doing what you do best &amp; let others say what they will!"
2955,2018-12-25 09:02:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Whether you’re celebrating #Christmas or not, whether you're on holiday or not,  be respectful &amp; learn to coexist peacefully. Learn to accept difference of opinion. Imposing your opinion on others won't heal the ailing globe. Hate less &amp; love more. #HappyHolidays #BuildingBridges"
2956,2018-12-24 21:02:55+00:00,muftimenk,Being too attached to this world will wear out your soul. A person who tries to please people &amp; gain their admiration or approval will exhaust himself. It’s a tremendous waste of time as such commendations are worthless in the end. Seek the pleasure of the Almighty instead!
2957,2018-12-24 07:26:16+00:00,muftimenk,"When you become excessively dependent on someone, the Almighty will either remove or detach you from that person just to show you where your strength lies. Yes, we all need people in our lives but never as much as we need the Almighty! He’s the only One who won’t disappoint!"
2958,2018-12-23 17:55:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feel proud when you’ve done a good deed. It happened because the Almighty allowed it &amp; guided you to it. Don’t brag about it and waste all the good you’ve earned. Remember, if it weren’t for Him, none of it would have happened."
2959,2018-12-23 11:13:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Having visited #Indonesia recently &amp; met its kind hearted, soft natured people, my heart really goes out to them. The volcanic eruption &amp; tsunami that have just struck them is the latest in a series of natural disasters. Almighty. Forgive us all &amp; save them from further calamity."
2960,2018-12-23 04:13:24+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think whatever you’re going through makes no sense. Remember, you may not be able to comprehend it but the Almighty can.

Will you not trust?"
2964,2018-12-21 12:35:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let unkind people stop you from being kind.  Remember, the people most in need of some kindness are those who seem strangers to it. So go out of your way to be kind to those most in need of our kindness, the unkind people of the world. #lovepreacher"

2967,2018-12-20 03:31:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Recognize when things no longer serve a purpose. You let them go not because of arrogance or pride but because they don’t fit into your life anymore. So close the chapter, learn the lessons and shake off the dust. Don’t waste your life. Move on."
2968,2018-12-19 13:58:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Our use of technology is causing a huge family divide because we just can’t put down our phones. Parents &amp; children spend hours on mobile devices, cutting down the time for face to face interaction. Make an effort to reduce the use of your devices &amp; start building relationships."
2969,2018-12-19 03:21:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t take this life for granted. Here today, gone tomorrow is real and many of us have seen it happen to our loved ones and close friends. We never know when our time will be up. So forgive, spread goodness and pray that the Almighty takes us when He is most pleased with us!"
2970,2018-12-18 18:20:42+00:00,muftimenk,"When you call upon the Almighty, always be certain that He will answer. Know in your hearts that He will respond in one way or another. In fact, He already knew even before you asked Him. Don’t supplicate with an attitude of doubt and uncertainty. Have firm belief &amp; trust Him!"
2971,2018-12-18 07:17:35+00:00,muftimenk,"You can be the most successful person around but if you have no humility, you won’t go far. There are many out there who strut around behaving like they own the world. It's a shame that those with less to boast about,  do it the most.  Such is the state of society today."
2972,2018-12-17 17:04:29+00:00,muftimenk,"You keep sinning &amp; He keeps forgiving! That’s a fact. For as long as you’re repenting &amp; turning back to Him, that’s all that matters. You may have broken your promise to the Almighty hundreds of times, but His Mercy is limitless &amp; He is always waiting to forgive! Again &amp; again!"
2973,2018-12-17 05:38:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t give up now. You’ve come this far. The difficult days will make way for happier days soon enough. Remember, nothing lasts.

2974,2018-12-16 20:01:59+00:00,muftimenk,"We emphasize so much  on external beauty that we often neglect our internal self. Remember, the Almighty looks at the state of our hearts. He doesn’t look at our figure nor the attire. So before hearts become diseased, ugly and unhealthy, let us strive to purify them."
2975,2018-12-16 04:14:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you ever feel stuck? Like being in a rut; a life filled with regrets, whys and what ifs playing back and forth in your mind? It’s the work of Satan. The Almighty wants you back on the path, no matter how far you’ve deviated. His everlasting Mercy awaits you. Turn to Him."
2976,2018-12-15 20:35:51+00:00,muftimenk,The best arguments are those that you avoid. Try your best to stay out of arguing when it’s worthless and can lead to enmity. But they can be commendable when they are intended to show the truth or to direct others to the truth. Choose your battles wisely!
2977,2018-12-15 07:16:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t waste your good deeds by showing off or reminding others what you’ve done. You should do it sincerely for the sake of the Almighty ; without being stingy or afraid that it would decrease your wealth. And never look down upon any charity, no matter how small it may be."
2978,2018-12-14 22:16:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Non-stop complaining to anyone who’ll listen to you while at the same time wallowing in self-pity &amp; negativity is wrong. More so if you have no desire to solve the matter. Instead, try choosing thoughts that will lead to a solution. Remember the blessings He has bestowed on us."
2979,2018-12-14 12:49:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Understand that disappointment is not a bad thing. When something we dislike happens, we think it’s a mistake. We get upset. We forget that the Almighty is in control. He sees things we don’t. The bigger picture will emerge soon and we will thank Him for His Infinite Wisdom!"
2980,2018-12-14 03:57:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, may we always remember that life on earth’s short. Eternity’s forever. Your promises are true. No matter how hard this journey is, we’ve to trust &amp; carry on. We’re no stranger to trials. We’ve done it before. We’ll do it again with Your help."

2982,2018-12-13 18:42:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you experiencing something that appears to have no solution. You feel almost certain there’s no way out. Remember, don’t consider your circumstances, consider what the Almighty can do. He knows things which we don’t.  He is the Owner of  Miracles. Nothing is impossible!"
2983,2018-12-13 11:09:23+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how good you are to certain people, they may never reciprocate and treat you in the same way. Learn to accept this. It may not be easy but it’s the most logical and wise thing to do! Such is life. Don’t lose sleep over it!"
2984,2018-12-13 03:08:32+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have faith in the Almighty, you don’t have to worry about anything. If it’s gone, He will replace it, if you want something,  ask Him for it. If it hasn’t happened yet, then make peace with it. Remember, He wants the best for you, even if you have to learn it the hard way!"
2985,2018-12-12 18:47:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary when angry. When you react in anger thinking you must hurt those who hurt you, think again. In fact, you’re hurting yourself. That’s why it’s always better to calm down &amp; act rationally later on. When you choose to react immediately, the consequences can be disastrous!"
2986,2018-12-12 12:02:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Let us admit that we all need love, kindness and care to get through that tough week, the grey skies and storm clouds in life.

2993,2018-12-10 05:51:40+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s human nature to forget, overloooking the countless blessings the Almighty has bestowed on us. Yet, when the slightest thing go wrong, we show ingratitude by grumbling, mumbling and complaining. Learn to feel complete gratitude in your heart. He’ll multiply your blessings."
2994,2018-12-10 01:36:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Sincerity is a secret between a person and the Almighty. It’s a priceless trait He has placed in the hearts of some people. The ones who strive to get close to Him, doing things only for His sake and not for fame, glory, wealth and status which will be useless in the Hereafter!"
2995,2018-12-09 07:00:06+00:00,muftimenk,Many people will tell you that they started with nothing and made it to the top through nothing but their own efforts. They exaggerate their challenges to make others feel that there’s no way they could do the same. Don’t be fooled. It’s the Almighty’s will every step of the way!
2996,2018-12-08 22:15:08+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will put different people in your life to test you. The sincere, the hypocrite, the pretender, the wise, those with hidden agenda. You will learn about each one just as He had intended for you. So be wary of the company you keep. Be conscious of who’s around you!"
2997,2018-12-08 12:39:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t stress yourself over what people are saying about you. You can’t stop them. They’ll say what they want. But remember, they can’t prevent what the Almighty has decreed for you, no matter how hard they try. So take it easy and let them do their thing. He is All-Knowing."
2998,2018-12-08 04:12:27+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re among the guided ones and you’re now doing what the Almighty has asked of you, count your blessings. Don’t look down on those who are not there yet. Instead, be patient and pray for them. Don’t give up on people. Remember, the Almighty guides whom He wills!"
2999,2018-12-07 20:12:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop stressing when others give up on you, walk out on you and turn their backs on you. It’s not the end of the world! The Almighty will see to it that you weather the storms in life, if you bear beautiful patience and trust Him. Don’t hesitate!"
3000,2018-12-07 13:58:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t let the opinion of others steal your confidence or cause you to cut back on whatever good you’re doing. Let them say what they want because you can’t stop people from speaking their minds. Remember at the end of the day, only the Almighty’s judgement matters."
3001,2018-12-07 03:49:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, help us see the value of what we’re going through. We know nothing has been wasted. The good, the bad, the ugly we’ve experienced have all been for a purpose. We may not have understood the pain of the experience but we have full faith in You!"
3002,2018-12-06 19:47:47+00:00,muftimenk,"We all face challenges in life. And at times, it can feel like those challenges may just beat you down. But if you want something, you have to keep going. Don’t let the idea of quitting enter your mind; stay strong. The people who win in life are the ones who don’t quit."
3003,2018-12-06 05:21:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you suffer from the disease where you constantly seek the approval of others? People-pleasers are the go-to person who will always change their plans at a moment’s notice. The one who will always say yes. The one who never says no. If you are, it’s time to rethink your life!"
3004,2018-12-05 20:17:40+00:00,muftimenk,Gossip is verbal poison. It seeks to defame &amp; discredit others. It’s hurtful &amp; dangerous. It’s the quickest way to destroy trust and friendships. Don’t take it lightly. You may think it’s harmless but you’re actually ruining someone’s reputation. You’ll pay a high price for it.
3005,2018-12-05 11:02:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Be less quick to react to people or situations. Often, they are powerless when you are less reactive. When people provoke you, try distancing yourself from them. They want you to lose your cool &amp; get angry. Don’t give in to them. Train yourself to stay calm instead."
3006,2018-12-05 03:28:51+00:00,muftimenk,You’re disappointed not because of other people’s behavior but because of your own expectations. Accept the fact that people will let you down. Time and again. They’ll show you their true colours eventually. Learn to expect only from the One who made you. He always delivers!
3007,2018-12-04 20:28:31+00:00,muftimenk,Don't take those closest to you for granted. They’re humans too and need to know they’re appreciated and cherished. Don’t just assume they know how you feel. Tell them using the kindest and most loving words. Remind them that they’re a blessing in your life.
3008,2018-12-04 04:27:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Many want to marry but they forget that staying married is hard work. It doesn’t just happen. “Easy” was never part of the agreement. Don’t think divorce is the easy way out because it isn’t. Work hard at your marriage. Remember, everything in life improves when we work at it!"
3009,2018-12-03 21:32:05+00:00,muftimenk,When in Rome do as the Romans do. But when in Oman... Please tell me what I should do? #justforlaughs #lovepreacher #oman https://t.co/vTN9MeKp8S
3010,2018-12-03 21:01:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through; disappointment, struggles, challenges will all make sense eventually. You just have to be patient. When it happens, you’ll be so thankful that you didn’t quit or give up. The Almighty only wants what is best for you in the end!"
3011,2018-12-03 12:04:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Not everyone will understand your journey, the path you’re taking. That’s ok. You’re not alone. Not everyone will understand your vision and goals. That’s ok because the Almighty does. He gave you those dreams. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise."
3012,2018-12-02 21:48:03+00:00,muftimenk,It doesn’t matter if everyone else is doing it. You don’t have to be part of that crowd. It will get you nowhere. Let go of the need to compare yourself with everyone else. Do what matters most in your life. After all it is your life; you’re not living someone else’s life!
3013,2018-12-02 13:46:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Before pointing a finger, nitpicking on others or condemning another person's shortcomings, do remember that we’re all sinners. No one is prefect. We are all answerable to our Creator. He is All-Knowing. So choose to advise with wisdom &amp; patience over exposing people’s faults!"
3014,2018-12-02 06:34:21+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel low &amp; depressing thoughts seem to get you down, keep a smile on your face. Thank the Almighty you're alive. Seek forgiveness because regardless of your condition, someone is worse than you. Be grateful to Him upon all conditions &amp; He will increase your sustenance."
3015,2018-12-01 17:26:11+00:00,muftimenk,Never doubt what the Almighty can do. The Lord of the Worlds can change things in the blink of an eye. So don’t stress over your current situation. He can replace what you’ve lost. He can suddenly open doors you never dreamed would open. Your job is to trust Him.
3016,2018-12-01 11:34:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Negative thoughts produce bad feelings like anger, envy, jealousy, hatred, anxiety, etc. These are thoughts about the world, our wealth, our status, people we do not like or who have wronged us... Detach your heart from these worldly things which don’t last. Feel the relief!"
3017,2018-12-01 00:29:58+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, we condemn good people because we disagree with them over a few issues. We refuse to see the good they’re doing. Disagreements do not automatically make a person extreme, bad or evil. Learn to distinguish between the one who respectfully disagrees &amp; the one who is evil!"
3018,2018-11-30 11:35:57+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re true to yourself, whatever bad someone tries to do or whatever they did to embarrass you can only strengthen you. Don’t worry about the plotters &amp; evil doers, they will have their day. Remember, the consequences of their actions will have to be dealt with eventually."
3019,2018-11-30 04:28:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we thank You for replacing our anxieties with peace and a calm heart. Thank You for strengthening us in our time of weakness. Thank You for picking us up each time we fall. May we never forget to thank You for everything! Aameen."
3020,2018-11-29 20:25:18+00:00,muftimenk,"If you ask for the Almighty’s help, rest assured it will always come but more often, not how you expect. But the way it comes is exactly what you need! He knows that. Only He knows you better than you know yourself. Bear patience and wait for the best outcome!"
3021,2018-11-29 05:30:30+00:00,muftimenk,"When you judge others, you’re actually issuing an invitation to them to judge you.  Stop focusing on people’s faults; instead focus on their strengths. Train yourself to only look for the good in others. You’ll be a happier person, attracting more positivity into your life."
3022,2018-11-28 22:55:30+00:00,muftimenk,"There will be times when you feel like everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong. You feel like it’s the end of the road for you and you’re stuck in a rut. Remember, sometimes you have to go through the roughest patch to arrive at your best. Be patient!"
3023,2018-11-28 19:35:59+00:00,muftimenk,"In this world, that’s full of negativity and harsh criticism, be a beacon of hope and positivity. How difficult is it to say a good word, to encourage and motivate others? And if you can’t, at least don’t hurt people with your words or actions. It’s best to remain quiet."
3024,2018-11-28 07:35:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of the online world. When you let yourself go, you run into the danger of slipping too far into it &amp; losing a sense of real life, real self and real priorities. It can distract people so much from reality that they may forget who they really are! It’s happening now!"
3025,2018-11-27 20:38:25+00:00,muftimenk,"People often ask, what if things don’t work out? What they mean is, if things don’t happen the way they planned it! They forget that the Almighty is the best planner. He will make things happen in the best possible way for us. Better than what we wanted. Trust Him!"
3026,2018-11-27 09:38:42+00:00,muftimenk,"In this world, that’s full of negativity and harsh criticism, be a beacon of hope and positivity. How difficult is it to say a good word, to encourage and motivate others? And if you can’t, at least don’t hurt people with your words or actions. It’s best to remain quiet."
3027,2018-11-27 02:58:55+00:00,muftimenk,"How do we understand the Almighty’s Plan for us in this confusing journey called life? It boils down to our link with Him. If you’re trying to get close to Him, He will show you the way. Bit by bit, it will unfold &amp; become clearer what He has in store for you. Build that link"
3028,2018-11-26 17:20:49+00:00,muftimenk,The devil will trick you into thinking that you won’t be happy until you get to where you think you should be. Learn to be happy with the here and now. Appreciate what’s in front of you. Be happy with what the Almighty has bestowed upon you. He won’t hesitate to take it away!
3029,2018-11-26 12:20:25+00:00,muftimenk,"You need to understand this. When someone betrays you, it’s a blessing. Imagine going though life not knowing that someone had bad intention towards you. It’s the Almighty’s way of exposing them. Be grateful and move on. It won’t be easy but remember it could have been worse!"
3030,2018-11-26 04:13:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever is going on in your life, don’t call it quits. You’ve come this far. Do you think the Almighty will abandon you? Don’t let doubt and despair set in. Hold on tight because He knows what you’re patiently enduring. He is always on your side. Trust Him!"
3031,2018-11-25 14:47:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When your heart is hurting, you think you’ve reached the end of the road and you feel empty; be careful what you fill it with! Satan is an opportunist. He will unleash many evil thoughts; strive to block him out. Turn to the Almighty. Seek His help. Only He can heal you!"
3032,2018-11-25 06:18:55+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s all part of life. People will cause you pain, hurt you, put you down, make you feel bad about yourself. It’s how you react that will determine the outcome. Remember, they are powerless until you choose to empower them. Don’t give them the ammunition they need!"
3033,2018-11-24 22:42:42+00:00,muftimenk,"You hear this often enough. People say that if they could live their lives over again, they’d do things differently. We fail to realise that each new day the Almighty gives us, is a day to change where we’re headed in life. Don’t waste that opportunity. Not everyone gets it!"
3034,2018-11-24 08:35:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Ultimately, even the greatest of deeds can be of no benefit if the hearts are sick; if the hearts are corrupt; if the hearts are laced with envy, pride, jealousy, hatred etc. So pay great attention to the state of your heart because everything you do flows from it!"
3035,2018-11-23 20:16:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t stereotype people and label someone as huge, fat, oversized, obese, thin, scrawny etc. It’s a mean thing to do. The Almighty made us all special in our own way. Each one has his own unique qualities. So stop having set ideas about people and look at them as individuals."

3037,2018-11-23 07:03:35+00:00,muftimenk,Thank the Almighty for the closed doors in our lives. Often we look at them and wonder why is He not giving us what we want so badly. They’re closed for a reason. Not to hurt us but to protect us. Trust Him and His flawless judgement. The Lord of the Worlds is the Best Planner!
3038,2018-11-22 23:56:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, grant us the ability to help each other, the patience &amp; understanding to deal with each other, to utter good words &amp; encourage others. Guide us towards Your Path, the path of true success. Grant us the best of this world &amp; the Hereafter."
3039,2018-11-22 15:25:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re facing now, always remember, the Almighty would not have allowed it unless He had a purpose to it. He doesn’t just act randomly. Each trial is aimed at making you learn something, making you grow as a person. Understand His Plan and you’ll emerge stronger."
3040,2018-11-22 03:21:22+00:00,muftimenk,"When you pray for something bad to happen to someone because they’ve hurt you, know that it can come back to you in unimaginable ways. When you’re plotting  against someone, remember the Almighty is aware. Good begets good. Never have a bad intent or make a bad prayer for others!"
3041,2018-11-21 20:40:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Why do we always feel the need to be nosey? Why do we have to know everything that’s going on in someone else’s life? You would be surprised with how much positive changes that you could make in your life, if you made it a priority to mind your own business!"
3042,2018-11-21 10:16:57+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re still looking for a spouse, you have to believe this and trust the Almighty. He has prepared someone perfectly just for you. Sooner or later, He will bring you together. So keep asking. Don’t give up hope. He’s All-Knowing!"
3043,2018-11-20 21:28:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Always try to put yourself in someone else's shoes. Have a heart. Be compassionate. Everyone has a story. Choose kindness no matter what is being dished out. Try your best to remember this when you find 
being compassionate is too hard for you."
3044,2018-11-20 05:29:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Quit overthinking. Learn to let things go. Things which don’t matter. You can’t change what has happened but you can decide to make today  better than yesterday. Think of the blessings the Almighty has bestowed you with. Thank Him. And from a place of gratitude, go forward."
3045,2018-11-19 22:24:44+00:00,muftimenk,"We criticize others because we’re impatient. We don’t tolerate those who behave differently. We expect people to behave like us. When we focus on someone else’s flaw, we stop seeing the person. We just see their mistakes. Get rid of this bad habit. Work to improve ourselves!"
3046,2018-11-19 12:28:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t quit. Don’t give up. Keep going. The road may seem long and unending but remember, when nothing is certain, anything is possible. The Lord of the Worlds can change what’s impossible! Trust Him!"
3047,2018-11-19 06:27:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to listen more. As simple as it sounds, listening is a skill, an art and a discipline. Pay attention to what someone is saying. Listen to his words. It’s coming from his heart. The mouth will reveal what the heart feels. Listening can save you from a whole lot of trouble!"

3049,2018-11-18 12:29:09+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with social media is we misunderstand, misinterpret &amp; miss the message most of the time. We choose to attack someone through a screen, thinking no one knows who we are! Be careful. Things have a way of coming back to us sooner or later. The Almighty is All-Seeing!"
3050,2018-11-18 01:59:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Heartfelt congratulations to @ibusolih on his inauguration as the new President of the #Maldives. I pray that the country will see a new era of growth, goodness, peace and prosperity. May the Almighty bless you all. Aameen"

hope alive in our hearts. 
Aameen"
3052,2018-11-17 19:23:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Only the Almighty knows what we really need. We may yearn for something &amp; have been praying hard for it but it seems to elude us. Why? Because He knows what’s best. So when He gives something we don’t like or takes away something we like, trust Him. Because He knows best!"
3053,2018-11-17 09:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,"When things are smooth, when everything is easy, you don’t learn much; you’re hardly growing as a person. Remember, the greatest lessons are learnt when you go through hardship and the storms of life. Embrace them and know that you will emerge stronger and better than before!"
3054,2018-11-16 23:04:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Know that if people were to come together to benefit you with something, they won’t be able to do it except with what the Almighty had decreed for you. Similarly, if they had wanted to harm you, they won’t be able to do so except with something that He had written for you."
3055,2018-11-16 11:13:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the ones who need kindness the most are the ones who are strangers to it. Their hearts are hard and cold; they’d  generally have little or no regard about how their words and actions affect others. Still, be kind to them because your actions reflect who you truly are!"
3056,2018-11-16 01:41:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to make us kinder, gentler, more generous and forgiving people. Guide us for the times when we feel impatience rising and revenge taking root in our hearts. Heal our souls and soften us to always do what’s right and good. Aameen."
3057,2018-11-15 17:17:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Stay clear or walk away from an argument for the sake of peace. Speak your mind calmly and politely but never make them think they're right if what they have said was wrong. You can’t change people’s viewpoint and mindset overnight. Remember, guidance is from the Almighty!"
3058,2018-11-15 05:04:06+00:00,muftimenk,"It’s hard to tell who’s fake and who’s real these days. But don’t despair because the Almighty has a way of exposing such people. Carry on doing good. If you happen to fall prey to such people, learn from the lesson. Remember, they can’t fake it forever. The mask will fall off."
3059,2018-11-14 22:49:32+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is always more important than what others think of you. However, there is a way of presenting the truth. There is no need to insult, abuse &amp; defame others in the process. Kind words with wisdom, showing true concern &amp; care are more likely to have the desired impact."
3060,2018-11-14 12:39:46+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what’s going on in life, remember that we’re fully reliant on the Almighty. He can take us at any time. So we must totally submit to Him &amp; obey His commands, lest we're taken while indulging in sin. Imagine facing the torment of the grave &amp; punishment of the hereafter"
3061,2018-11-14 04:20:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t think that there are people with a problem-free life out there. Every single person is fighting a battle, often hidden by a brave front. That’s why it’s important to have good character &amp; conduct. Remember, this world will break you. So lend a hand and have a good heart!"
3062,2018-11-13 17:31:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you know what inner strength is? It’s hanging on to hope and trust in the Almighty that despite the hardship and storm you’re facing right now, you’ll be fine in the end. Because He has promised us that nothing lasts; so lighten your heart!"
3063,2018-11-13 05:58:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes, a task can seem almost impossible. But remember to take baby steps; one foot in front of the other. You can always pause when you’re tired out. But take that first step, come what may! Don’t procrastinate. Before you know it, you would have completed the task!"
3064,2018-11-12 15:11:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t measure worldly success by a rich lifestyle &amp; all the modern day trappings. Measure it by the number of hearts you’ve touched, the faces who smile when they hear your name, the things people say about you in your absence! That’s a life well lived! Strive to get there!"
3065,2018-11-12 05:36:48+00:00,muftimenk,"People come in and out of your life for a reason. Nothing is by accident. It’s part of the Almighty’s Plan. Everyone will teach you a lesson. Good or bad, it’s up to you to decipher it. Not everyone you lose is a loss! Wait patiently and see what He has in store for you!"
3066,2018-11-11 16:22:47+00:00,muftimenk,"When you have repented, trust that the Almighty has forgiven you and move on. Don’t keep going back and forth, doubting if it was accepted etc. This is Satan’s trick. Don’t fall prey to it. Be single minded about it. Start doing good deeds and spreading kindness in your path."
3067,2018-11-11 06:07:12+00:00,muftimenk,Let others say what they want about you. Deep down you know who you are. The Almighty knows it too. He also knows what you stand for. So there’s no need to justify anything to anyone.  Be the best person you can under the given circumstances. Spread goodness!
3068,2018-11-10 21:36:32+00:00,muftimenk,I'm inspired by those who are very humble yet they've achieved more than most. One such person is Alhaji Aliko Dangote of Nigeria. An amazing brother who touches millions of lives in his own way. Africa's wealthiest man. May the Almighty bless him further. Aameen #alikodangote https://t.co/er5KcMf1Z2
3069,2018-11-10 11:30:08+00:00,muftimenk,"How worthy you are to others depends on your words. Choose them wisely. Once spoken, you can’t undo them. Many people are careless with their words. They curse, swear, hurl vulgarities, use harsh words which hurt others in the process. Don’t live to regret what you uttered!"
3070,2018-11-10 05:45:34+00:00,muftimenk,Haters are just people with low self esteem. They don’t believe in themselves; so they try to put other people down in a sick way to lift themselves up! Don’t let their criticism and negativity distract you from your goals in life!
3071,2018-11-09 22:41:27+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is we are addicted to haste. We want everything now, at this point in time. We find waiting a chore. But waiting is what we need for our soul. It inculcates self-discipline. It teaches us that the Almighty is in full control. It teaches us to accept His Decree!"
3072,2018-11-09 14:08:25+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how severe the pain or sickness gets, one is not allowed to hope or wish for death. Instead, seek help through patience &amp; prayer. The death wish reflects a belief that the Almighty has burdened us beyond our capacity. It shows a lack of patience on our part!"
3073,2018-11-09 04:29:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, make us realize that the more we help others get ahead in life, the higher we will rise. Help us reach out to humanity at large; to encourage and inspire the people around us in all that we do. May we always motivate &amp; have a good word for others!"
3074,2018-11-08 20:45:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Always take the high road &amp; do the right thing, even if it may not be easy or popular with most. Choose the course of action which is moral or acceptable &amp; which is least likely to harm or upset other people. It’s challenging because life is tough but the rewards are tremendous"
3075,2018-11-08 05:51:38+00:00,muftimenk,Some people only feel worthy when they surround themselves with important people. Depending on others to make you feel good is like chasing a moving target. You can't control what other people think of you &amp; certainly can't please everyone all the time. So don’t waste your time
3076,2018-11-07 22:36:07+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how hard you think your life is,
No matter how much you’re suffering, 
No matter how dark your days are, 
No matter how sad &amp; broken you feel, remember this,
The Almighty has promised that nothing lasts!  Keep going. The road to Paradise is full of stumbling blocks!"
3077,2018-11-07 07:26:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember that kindness is a strength. It’s not easy being kind, especially to those who are rude to you. On the other hand, being rude is easy. But it shows a sign of weakness. So choose to be strong and choose to leave a trail of kindness and goodness wherever you go!"
3078,2018-11-06 20:48:43+00:00,muftimenk,"The evil eye is real. Protect yourself as best you can. Take precautions. For many, this will be hard because we live in such a self-serving society today. We want to show off! There’s a need within many of us to be validated &amp; accepted by others; even people we don’t know!"
3079,2018-11-06 05:07:34+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty has blessed each one of us differently. Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't. Humble yourself. Learn as much as you can. Put it to good use to benefit not only yourself but those around you as well!
3080,2018-11-05 21:44:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Be thankful when someone hurts you &amp; shakes you to the core. When you’re at your lowest, that’s when you’re most likely to turn to the Almighty to heal you because no one else can! It’s a reminder that people will continue to hurt you. Cry out to Him sincerely &amp; He will heal you!"
3081,2018-11-05 16:49:37+00:00,muftimenk,"For those who missed the historic #BuildingBridges speech entitled ""Respecting Differences"" at the Independence Stadium in the #Gambia. Here is the link. Please share it to maximise the benefit. https://t.co/e3Er7sm4aa"
3082,2018-11-05 13:26:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. 
I trust You through my pain,
my suffering, my heartache, my sadness, my confusion, my heedlessness. I know Your Mercy overpowers Your Wrath. That’s why I never lose hope, despite my sins and my transgressions, I trust You. I thank You for always being there for me."
3083,2018-11-05 03:04:57+00:00,muftimenk,"The closer you get to the Almighty, the more you’ll understand His Plan. Every trial you’re going through is to get you on track for what’s to come. It may not be obvious now but the picture will emerge when the last piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. Trust Him!"
3084,2018-11-04 11:50:15+00:00,muftimenk,"People tend to follow the crowd. They think if everyone else is doing it, there must be something to it. They don’t want to miss out on whatever it is. Stop! Many in the crowd actually don’t know why they’re there. Be unique. Be yourself. Be a leader."
3085,2018-11-03 12:10:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Ahead of my ""Respecting Differences"" lecture, I met with Gambia President, HE Adama Barrow at the State House. We discussed peace &amp; stability, inter faith respect &amp; coexistence, tolerance &amp; positive growth. A great man with a great task. May the Almighty grant us every success. https://t.co/nki41aT4aB"
3086,2018-11-03 07:33:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Give thanks, focus on the the positive and resist the temptation to grumble. All these will protect our hearts as we carry on and fight the storms of life. A situation doesn’t have to be without negatives in order for us to give thanks. The Almighty knows!"
3087,2018-11-02 23:20:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Family interference is one of the reasons why marriages fail. When spouses share personal or internal problems with family members, be prepared for trouble. Problems get distorted. Problems become larger than life. Try and settle your disputes without taking them to others."
3088,2018-11-02 12:04:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Our responsibilities are ours alone. No one owes us anything. Don’t expect anything from anyone. That way, you won’t begrudge anyone and you free your heart from any ill feelings towards others. Depend only on the Almighty. Know that He is  sufficient for you!"
3089,2018-11-02 05:49:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, keep us steadfast on the straight path and don’t make us among those who have earned your wrath and gone astray. Help us bear beautiful patience no matter what situation we’re in right now. We know You’ll give us the best even if it takes time!"
3090,2018-11-01 20:53:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people will be offended by your success and your rise in status in society. These are the ones who want to control, manipulate and keep you down. They’re unhappy when you do well. Don’t worry about them. They have no power over you. Seek your strength from the Almighty."
3091,2018-11-01 11:52:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful what you share on social media.  Even among our family members, there may be people who hide ill feelings towards our achievements, beauty &amp; lifestyles behind their smiles. The sad part is that most of the time, people envy what we know isn’t completely real!"
3092,2018-11-01 03:33:12+00:00,muftimenk,The truth is some people will hate you because you are exactly what they wish but failed to be. They won’t hesitate to spread rumours and gossip about you. This is a test from the Almighty. Don’t retaliate. Let the good you do speak for itself.
3093,2018-10-31 20:07:20+00:00,muftimenk,"We are all guests in this world. As the rule goes, all guests will have to leave sooner or later. Death is the common factor for all. If this becomes the cornerstone of our lives, then it gets easier to rid our hearts of animosity, hatred, jealousy, envy, grudge and hostility!"
3094,2018-10-31 11:17:03+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, the Almighty holds us back temporarily because He knows things we don’t. We tend to get upset when we see a roadblock, not knowing that He’s protecting us. Learn to read the signs &amp; understand His Plan. You’ll become more grateful for everything that happens in life!"
3095,2018-10-31 03:53:52+00:00,muftimenk,You can forgive completely but still choose to keep a safe distance from that person to protect yourself from unwanted harm or a repeat of what happened in the first place. Forgiving doesn't require you to embrace or interact with the one you forgave. Don't confuse the two.
3096,2018-10-30 17:43:19+00:00,muftimenk,"This world is such that it will break your heart. Without a doubt. In fact, it will even crush it if you allow it. Remember, the Almighty will never leave you in that state. He will fix it. Turn to Him, the Owner of hearts, sincerely and let a Him heal you as only He knows how!"
3097,2018-10-30 06:49:23+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t be obsessed with things that went wrong or didn’t work out. That’s life in a nutshell. Keep going. You’ll never win this race of life if you keep looking back. The mistakes you’ve made don’t define who you are today. Think positive that things will get better!
3098,2018-10-29 20:24:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Almost daily, we hear of senseless killings, bombings, natural disasters &amp; accidents where many lose their lives. We're always saddened by such news and feel helpless. We sympathise with the affected families and pray for them. May the Almighty protect us &amp; have mercy on us all."
3099,2018-10-29 13:55:04+00:00,muftimenk,Forgiveness can be more challenging with family because deeper emotions are involved when a family member hurts us. Choosing not to forgive &amp; breaking ties of kinship is wrong. So do the right thing &amp; forgive because forgiveness helps both sides! It’ll give you peace of mind!
3100,2018-10-29 03:28:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Many of us are stressed because we are in a hurry. We have this mental schedule which must be achieved by a certain time; get a degree, a good job, get married, have kids. We get upset when the schedule is out of sync. Trust that what He has decreed for you will be yours!"
3101,2018-10-28 17:36:00+00:00,muftimenk,Respect yourself enough to let go of those who are not worthy of your friendship; those who treat you any which way to suit their whims &amp; fancies; those who don’t respect you and constantly put you down. The Almighty knows you’ve tried. Don’t let the experience make you bitter!
3102,2018-10-28 06:00:14+00:00,muftimenk,You may think that you’ve wasted so many years of your precious life having turned away form the Almighty. Don’t go down that road. Don’t think that way. The Almighty can restore all those years once you’ve turned to Him sincerely. Nothing is ever wasted where He is concerned!
3103,2018-10-27 15:46:10+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel like you’re losing everything you’ve dreamed of, know that it’s the Almighty testing your faith. Whatever hardship He puts in your path, know that He’s always with you, every step of the way. Don’t lose hope. Don’t lose your faith. He has the best plans for you!"
3104,2018-10-27 06:34:46+00:00,muftimenk,Everything in life is in a state of change. Nothing stays constant. The Almighty is the only One who remains entirely consistent. So learn not to put your hope and trust in people or circumstances. They can change anytime. Give your all to the Almighty!
3105,2018-10-26 23:11:11+00:00,muftimenk,"If you still think money is the route to happiness, you’re wrong. A healthy body, a tranquil soul, a pure heart, a caring spouse &amp; children, a mother’s love; these are just some of the things that will give meaning to your life. All the wealth in the world can’t buy you that!"
3106,2018-10-26 14:18:16+00:00,muftimenk,"The way you treat your parents says a lot about you as a person. Some of us are more mature than others. But it’s never easy, there's always a rough patch because we are only human. Your parents just want to see you do things they couldn't do. Be the best child you can be!"
3107,2018-10-26 03:25:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, make us realize that everything will work out in the end. No matter how long we’ve been suffering, how long we’ve been supplicating, let us remember that only You can change the most hopeless  situation to the best moment of our our lives."
3108,2018-10-25 19:25:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When you seek forgiveness from the Almighty, you have won a great battle against Satan. But he will try to trap you once again. He wants you to doubt the Mercy of the Most Merciful. So after you've sincerely repented, never allow yourself to feel that you haven't been forgiven."
3109,2018-10-25 12:18:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan does not want you to repent at all. But if he fails in his attempt, the next best plan is to delay your repentance. He tries to tell you that it will be easier later on. That’s a lie. The longer things go on, the harder it gets to repent. Don’t wait. Do it today!"
3110,2018-10-25 05:57:10+00:00,muftimenk,"When things don’t work out the way you thought they would, it’s human nature to feel let down, depressed and despondent. Remember, it’s not the end. The Almighty has the best plan for you. You have to believe that. Be patient and everything will unfold right before your eyes!"
3111,2018-10-24 21:28:47+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone has failed in what they set out to do, don’t push them down even harder. Give a word of encouragement. Uttering good words to someone after failure is worth more than all the praise you can give after success."
3112,2018-10-24 12:22:42+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let your past affect your present. Some people believe they’ve sinned so much that the Almighty won’t forgive them! He is the most forgiving. Turn to Him without hesitation. He will erase your past if you’re sincere. His Mercy is greater than all your sins put together!
3113,2018-10-24 03:39:21+00:00,muftimenk,"If you live your life making decisions based on what others will think of you, it’s time for a rethink! Nothing you do will be good enough. You can’t please everyone. Please the Almighty. The owner &amp; source of peace."
3114,2018-10-23 17:39:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t worry about how people act. That’s on them not you. Always choose kindness, that’s under your control. Spread it far and wide, whichever way you can, even if it means giving a smile or a word of encouragement. Never underestimate how contagious being kind can be!"
3115,2018-10-23 08:55:22+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let bitterness and resentment take root in your heart. They’re poison which will harm your soul eventually. Let go of the hurt or hate that comes with it. Turn to the Almighty and let Him heal you. Feel whole again with a much lighter heart!
3116,2018-10-22 16:38:21+00:00,muftimenk,"How often have you felt like you’re giving but never receiving anything in return. Each time you placed your trust in others, you were betrayed. It’s a fact of life. Don’t expect anything from others. Each man for himself is how we’ve become. Depend on the Almighty Alone!"
3117,2018-10-22 06:00:10+00:00,muftimenk,"If you don't understand what’s going on in your life, don't get discouraged or frustrated. The Almighty knows what we don’t. He never promised that everything would make sense, but He did promise that you would be ok in the end! Just trust Him!"
3118,2018-10-21 18:26:38+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think the hardest trials are with your wealth, health or loss of a loved one. But the tragic truth is the worst trial is possibly a heart that is hardened, a heart that feels nothing when a sin is committed and a heart that rejects repeated warnings!"
3119,2018-10-21 09:37:59+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is nobody is born a racist. You have to be taught. Are we dealing with racism, bigotry and prejudice in our own lives so that we can be examples to our children and those under our charge? Do we reject someone only because of his skin colour? Time for reflection!"
3120,2018-10-20 22:25:40+00:00,muftimenk,Everyone will have their opinion about you; who you are and what you stand for. None of these opinions matter because the Almighty is the only one who knows the real YOU. Work hard at being the best possible version of yourself. Don't be distracted.
3121,2018-10-20 12:34:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Time is a gift from the Almighty. How do you use it? You can either use it to worry and complain or to pray. Remember, one drains you the other changes you. The choice is yours. Make a wise choice. Experience the positive effect it will have in your life!"
3122,2018-10-20 02:59:45+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t worry about what has passed. Where you’re headed is more important than where you’ve been. Look ahead with hope in the Almighty’s Mercy. That is what you need to see you through. So keep going and don’t look back because you’re not revisiting the past any longer.
3123,2018-10-19 14:58:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Think well of others and see what it does to your heart. Each time you hear something bad about someone, don’t spread it, give him the benefit of the doubt. Put yourself in his position. Protect yourself from worrisome thoughts that disturb your mind. Keep the peace!"
3124,2018-10-19 04:24:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we thank You for guiding us when we felt lost &amp; didn't know where to go, for always being there when everyone abandoned us, for shining Your light when we felt afraid of the dark &amp; for carrying us through when we thought we couldn't make it!"
3125,2018-10-18 21:49:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Protect your good deeds at all costs. Foolish is the one who does a lot of good but doesn’t control his tongue and engages in backbiting, gossip &amp; slander without batting an eyelid. He may turn up Judgement Day as a bankrupt, having to repay everyone he has wronged!"
3126,2018-10-18 15:44:48+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, you may have to let go of certain people in order to please the Almighty. You may feel alone initially but the truth is you’re never lonely. He is always there for you. You only have to reach out to Him &amp; when you put Him before everything else, He’ll reward you!"
3127,2018-10-18 07:48:45+00:00,muftimenk,"We all face challenges, obstacles, roadblocks and difficulties in life. Who doesn’t? But if you focus on your problem, you’re going to end up miserable. Bear patience &amp; think ahead. The Almighty will pave a way if you trust Him. Don’t focus on the problems, focus on Him!"
3128,2018-10-17 21:11:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Help others and the Almighty will help you. Remember, He’s the Owner of everything. Whatever you have, comes from Him. As much as He gives, He can also take away in the blink of an eye. So be wary how you treat people. He’s aware and knows if you’re mean and stingy to others."
3129,2018-10-17 14:29:17+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as you want to change a person, be it your loved one, a friend or anyone for that matter, you can’t. The truth is only the Almighty can do that. You can advise, show them the way, speak to them repeatedly but guidance comes from Him. So pray for them and leave it to Him!"
3130,2018-10-16 20:31:44+00:00,muftimenk,Look down upon the sin &amp; not the sinner. The fact is we all sin. Every single one of us. Stop thinking you’re above everyone else. Don’t treat others like they are insignificant. A person who is down today can climb up tomorrow. Only the Almighty knows what the future holds!
3131,2018-10-16 04:44:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyone should do good to his family members first. Charity to others at the expense of those under your care at home is not right and won’t go down well. If a man ignores his family &amp; does good to others, that is unacceptable. After the Almighty, the family is your priority."
3132,2018-10-15 18:57:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re facing today, don’t complain.The battle, big or small, is an indicator of the size of blessing the Almighty is sending your way soon. Remember, He gives the toughest tests to His most beloved soldiers. Hang in there!"
3133,2018-10-15 11:38:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes when in a crisis, the only option we have is to hope things will get better. Together with prayer, hope and patience are great qualities to get us through the toughest of times. Remember, no difficulty is permanent. The Almighty has promised us with hardship comes ease!"
3134,2018-10-15 03:41:20+00:00,muftimenk,Quit trying to please everyone. It will tire you out. The Almighty didn’t say you need to win a popularity poll to get to Paradise. Do good. Don’t hurt others. Be the best version of yourself and let the Almighty do the rest!
3135,2018-10-14 14:11:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the gossiper. He usually has bad intent. He speaks negatively about others &amp; belittle their worth to increase his own. If you’re in the company of such people &amp; the talk turns negative, look for ways to bring it back to a positive focus that is not belittling to others."
3136,2018-10-14 03:54:18+00:00,muftimenk,Social media can take a toll on your self-confidence. Many today are using it to compare themselves with others. Many more use it as a benchmark for how much they’ve achieved in life. Don’t fall into the trap.  Always remind yourself of who you are and your self-worth.
3137,2018-10-13 15:47:56+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how good a person you are, how kind you are, some will hate you. They’re committed to being mean and unreasonable to you. Don't worry. People often create their own drama out of jealousy. The Almighty knows. He will deal with them. Carry on doing what you do best!"
3138,2018-10-13 09:12:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you’re going through in life, be it an illness, a difficult divorce, death of a loved one, don’t be afraid. The Almighty will get you through it. No matter what others say, no matter how hopeless it seems, keep going. He will turn your patience into a beautiful ending!"
3139,2018-10-12 22:03:44+00:00,muftimenk,"When your past comes back knocking on your door, ignore it. Satan will tempt you to go that way again with repeated calls; do not answer! Remember, your past is over. The Almighty has forgiven you. Now it’s time to move forward and do what matters most!"
3140,2018-10-12 15:04:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Forgive the one who wronged you for your own sake. You will still remember what happened, but you’ll no longer be bound by it. But remember, forgiveness is a process. It may not happen immediately. It requires strength and you’re working towards it! That’s all that matters!"
3141,2018-10-12 05:15:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, grant strength to those suffering from natural disasters. Fill their hearts with hope as they pick up the pieces of their lives amid the devastation. Protect them &amp; grant good patience! Remember, He won’t burden a soul beyond that it can bear."
3142,2018-10-11 23:12:17+00:00,muftimenk,"You’re tired &amp; weary. You’re not alone. Your heart feels so much pain. You’re not alone. The thing is you need to be patient with what the Almighty has planned for you. For how long, you ask? All your sacrifices will be worth it. The more patient you are, the greater your reward!"
3143,2018-10-11 20:58:04+00:00,muftimenk,A good laugh. Nobody expected me to answer this way. Brought back childhood memories. #muftimenk https://t.co/YqNFVTewY1
3144,2018-10-11 14:41:09+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is we are all struggling. Our hearts and faith are constantly shifting. But know that every step we take is bringing us closer to the Almighty. Every desire we control, every good deed we do, every bad deed we avoid; He is aware of every single thing!"
3145,2018-10-11 06:55:03+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t let negative people ruin your positive mindset. Let them go before they completely infiltrate your mind. Such people have issues with themselves and with everything and everyone around them. Make a conscious effort to stay away from them. Don’t entertain such friendship!
3146,2018-10-10 20:56:22+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t wait to repent. Don’t listen to the whispering of Satan. Don’t let your trickle of sin become an ocean of regret. That’s foolish because the Almighty is always there to welcome you back on His Path. You only have to connect with Him. Ask Him. Sincerely.
3147,2018-10-10 13:04:11+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’ve been blessed with more, give; extend a helping hand. Avoid lending. If you do lend, don't expect it back. That’s the way of the world now. If it comes back, it's a bonus. If it doesn't, you expected it. Remember, your reward’s with the Almighty, the Owner of Sustenance."
3148,2018-10-10 07:39:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Be kind &amp; don’t abuse your spouse. Lack of kindness is the source of marital conflicts &amp; the cause of most divorces. Anger, selfish or irresponsible behavior &amp; criticism, push away kindness. Bit by bit, lack of kindness chips away the marriage foundation."
3149,2018-10-09 21:55:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, if the Almighty wants good for someone, He will create situations to draw him closer to his Maker. This can be in the form of poverty, heartbreak, repentance, desperate needfulness &amp; whatever else  through various means. Understand His Plan &amp; act accordingly!"
3150,2018-10-09 07:06:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Your haters may be trying their best to bring you down but remember, their best will never be enough. The Almighty knows their plans and their intent. So don’t be worried, anxious or afraid. Seek His protection from those trying to harm or cause  you hurt."
3151,2018-10-08 21:03:59+00:00,muftimenk,There’ll always be people wishing that you’d fail. They will be amused when you suffer setback after setback. Little do they know that the Almighty is planning a big comeback for you. It’s all a matter of time. Bear patience!
3152,2018-10-08 11:06:33+00:00,muftimenk,How many things in life are we waiting for others to say “yes” to? We request. We argue. We persuade. We try to change hearts. We forget that the heart of the one you turn to is in the control of the One you’ve turned away from for so long. Fix your relationship with Him first!
3153,2018-10-07 21:50:31+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste your time explaining to people who have already made up their minds about you; those who are committed to misunderstand you! They have an agenda. Don’t stress over them and get on with your life. They don’t deserve your attention.
3154,2018-10-07 09:40:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember that your struggles always lead to strength. Every difficulty in your life, whether big or small, is something that the Almighty will use to produce more strength, faith and perseverance in you if you let Him! All the pain that you endured has a purpose."
3155,2018-10-06 20:49:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t just hand over your heart to anyone. The strength of your heart comes with the worship of the Almighty. Is your heart at ease when you’re alone? Do you always need to be in the company of others? Remember, only when you constantly remember Him will your heart find peace."
3156,2018-10-06 12:03:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t keep looking for what’s missing in our lives. Learn to see the blessings that are actually there. Instead of focusing on what we have, we keep looking &amp; stressing over what we don’t have. When we see others, we think their lives are always grander than ours. That’s a myth"
3157,2018-10-06 04:55:06+00:00,muftimenk,"Each day is a mixture of good &amp; bad, highs &amp; lows, pleasure &amp; pain, joy &amp; sorrow. That’s the cycle of life.  Have the ability to see life beyond your own needs; empathize with others, give a little of yourself or your time to someone else for a change. Make a difference!"
3158,2018-10-05 15:17:34+00:00,muftimenk,Be yourself. Don’t be afraid of what people will say or think about you. They are just as flawed as you are. No one is perfect. Look into your heart and be concerned with purifying it so you can be the best version of yourself. Seek to please the Almighty. Not people!
3159,2018-10-05 04:37:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t treat people badly. Examine yourself constantly to make sure you’re not guilty of this. Because you can’t keep treating people badly and expect the Almighty to do nothing about it. Remember the rule of life; what you sow, you’ll reap."
3160,2018-10-04 18:51:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Are you spending time with the Almighty on a daily basis? If not, you won't be able to handle it when the pressure is on and you’re facing life’s trials. Remember, you need to set aside time for Him. Whatever it is you need to do to make Him part of your daily life, do it!"
3161,2018-10-04 10:48:06+00:00,muftimenk,We often hear people say follow your heart. The truth is don’t  follow your heart if your heart is leading you anywhere that is contrary to what the Almighty has prescribed.  Attaching your heart to anything else won’t last. It’s temporary and you’ll end up in despair.
3162,2018-10-04 03:42:52+00:00,muftimenk,Nobody has a perfect past. We all sin. There’s no exception. So don’t let that come between you and your relationship with the Almighty. He is waiting to forgive. He loves it when you ask and repent and depend on Him. That’s our Lord. Our Creator. Our Provider. Our Sustainer.
3163,2018-10-03 18:12:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t t take your trouble to bed with you each night. Rest well, knowing that whatever is troubling you, whatever is on your mind is being taken care of by the Almighty, the Owner of all Solutions. Remember, no problem is too huge for Him to handle."
3164,2018-10-03 08:47:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t stress over what’s to come. Take it one day at a time, one step at a time. Don’t rush things. You may have your own agenda, wanting immediate results, but know that everything works according to a schedule. Not yours but the Almighty’s!"
3165,2018-10-02 15:37:25+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is people spend so much money trying to combat &amp; get rid of stress in their lives, forgetting that stress will always be part of this world. That’s the nature of this short life. The solution is to attach your heart to the Almighty &amp; the Hereafter. That’s the only way"
3166,2018-10-02 08:27:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Never feel that you’re alone and that the Almighty has abandoned you. He has not. You may be the one crying at night, smiling in the day to hide your pain, feeling lost, confused or frustrated but never doubt that He knows what you’re going through. Always!"
3167,2018-10-01 21:06:55+00:00,muftimenk,Do your deeds quietly. Don’t brag about it on social media. It’s counter productive that way. You may get some reaction from people but that’s not what you should be concerned with. Your reward is with the Almighty. And that should be more than enough reason to stay low key!
3168,2018-10-01 14:00:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, people don’t know what you’re going through. They don’t feel what you feel. Train yourself to ignore what they say about you. You’ll feel liberated and at ease. You’ll feel a huge burden off your back. Your heart will feel so much lighter!"
3169,2018-10-01 04:04:00+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t forget that there’s nothing the Almighty cannot do and there is nothing that can keep you from the plans He has for you. Let others say what they want. Let them belittle you. Do not be shaken. Do not be rattled by them. He will move your mountain!
3170,2018-09-30 18:59:06+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t hold on to grudges. Grudges are for those who insist that they’re owed something. It’s one sure way to become miserable. Let it go &amp; heal your heart. You’ll find it easier to move on. Looking back isn’t going to help you. Moving forward is what we must do.
3171,2018-09-30 05:16:09+00:00,muftimenk,Remember that you do not make yourself look better by making someone else look worse. You do not appear more pious by implying others are less pious. Don’t even dare think that way. Just focus on yourself and let others do what they have to do. The Almighty is the Best Judge!
3172,2018-09-29 18:36:51+00:00,muftimenk,"The ones who are good to those who’ve hurt them, the ones who can still trust though they’ve been betrayed, the ones who show kindness to those who don’t deserve it - these will never go unnoticed by the Almighty. Such people will have a special reward! Aspire towards that!"
3173,2018-09-29 08:13:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Overthinking is actually a special form of fear. This fear is exaggerated and becomes worse when mixed with anticipation, anxiety, imagination and emotion. Learn to accept things as they are. Ask the Almighty to constantly guide you. What you can’t control, let Him take over."
3174,2018-09-28 19:01:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Humans are strange. We don't doubt the Almighty’s ability to keep the planets in orbit, the sun and the moon from colliding and the alternating cycle of night and day. Yet, we have a difficult time believing that He can and will attend to all our affairs. We only have to trust!"
3175,2018-09-28 08:44:17+00:00,muftimenk,Choose kindness above all else. Kind people use positivity as a lantern to create more light. That’s because they’ve seen what negativity can do to you. They make time for others in a world that doesn’t wait for anyone. It takes strength to shake off all the bad and move ahead!
3176,2018-09-27 22:17:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, keep our hearts soft and protect them from hardening. Shower us with Your Mercy, such that when we commit a sin, we feel the guilt that comes with it. Don’t make us among those who sin and yet don’t feel remorseful. Aameen."
3177,2018-09-27 16:13:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything you do comes back to you; whether good or bad. You’re a reflection of what you put out into the world. If you constantly use &amp; abuse people, life will use and abuse you. If you dedicate your life to doing good, you will be rewarded. Be positive, kind &amp; compassionate."
3178,2018-09-27 07:35:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever it is you want to do, do it now. Don't use the excuse of waiting for perfect timing to procrastinate. Perfection is not for this world. So before you end up miserable because you’ve been stuck waiting, act on it and start today."
3179,2018-09-26 18:19:36+00:00,muftimenk,"In this life, periods of ease and hardship will keep alternating; that’s why we should never get complacent when things are good. Remember, the best worship is waiting for the ease to come when you’re experiencing hardship."
3180,2018-09-26 11:13:43+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is you’re going to be slandered from time to time, so don’t allow it to throw you into emotional turmoil when it happens. If you feel the need to defend yourself against a lie, the best approach is to give yourself time to cool off. Think the matter through calmly."
3181,2018-09-26 05:19:21+00:00,muftimenk,"If you find yourself &amp; your conversation focusing on people; what’s going on in their lives, their relationships, their social status etc, then you have a serious problem on your hand. You need to get out of that mould; focus on yourself rather than being concerned with others."
3182,2018-09-25 12:42:03+00:00,muftimenk,"If you live your life worrying about who hurt you and who broke you down, you’re going to end up being miserable. Learn to look at the positive side; who was always there and helped you back on your feet again and made you smile once more!"
3183,2018-09-25 03:54:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Only the Almighty knows the state of our heart. He knows what lies ahead. He knows what’s best for us. So when we’re overwhelmed and anxious that things may not work out, remember this; He never makes mistakes!"
3184,2018-09-24 21:19:09+00:00,muftimenk,"We all get hurt. We all have wounds, but you cannot let that be an excuse to just sit around and do nothing. Remember, pain is part of life. Your emotional wounds strengthen you because they show you have lived a purposeful life."
3185,2018-09-24 15:05:32+00:00,muftimenk,The truth is we spend so much time doing useless things trying to impress people who don’t care much about us. Learn to shift your focus and do things that matter. Things that will draw you closer to the Almighty. Things that will have a bearing. Don’t worry about the masses!
3186,2018-09-24 03:59:09+00:00,muftimenk,"In hard times, we’re grateful to the Almighty by being patient and by recognizing that it could be much worse. Trust His Plan and have complete reliance on Him. We ask Him to make us among those who are patient and grateful, both in good and bad times."
3187,2018-09-23 18:57:30+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as we think multitasking is great, it can be detrimental in the long term. Try doing only one thing at a time today. When you’re listening to someone, really listen. When outdoors, enjoy the Almighty’s creation around you. You will become happier and more centered!"
3188,2018-09-23 11:56:59+00:00,muftimenk,True friends are hard to come by these days. The sad reality  is many friends will only like you for what you can do for them instead of for who you are. Identify such friends. Make a conscious effort to change for the better. You’ll start seeing a difference in your life!
3189,2018-09-23 04:02:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything you’re asking for will come to you in due time. Never be discouraged if what you got was not what you asked for originally. Remember, the Almighty knows what’s best for us. He will give you what you can handle. You’ll understand why He did what He did, eventually!"
3190,2018-09-22 16:58:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of keyboard warriors who engage in disputes on matters in which they have no right to speak about due to their lack of knowledge. Yet, they will openly and recklessly make online comments and verdicts on matters even the learned are cautious about."
3191,2018-09-22 06:28:24+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how dark your days seem, remember, the Almighty will never ask you to do something that you can’t do. You are fully equipped, qualified and capable. Put your trust in the Lord of the Worlds. With Him, nothing is impossible. Don’t let anyone talk you out of it!"
3192,2018-09-21 13:44:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Today, bullying no longer occurs only in schools. Social media has provided another way for bullies who seek to demean others. Home is no longer safe for victims of bullying; a Facebook status can hurt just as much, if not more, than hearing the typed words spoken out loud!"
3193,2018-09-21 04:16:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray for our parents and ask You to keep them in good health. Forgive their sins, have mercy on them as we know they always try to keep a brave front for their children. They have sacrificed much for us and may we never take them for granted."
3194,2018-09-20 20:48:25+00:00,muftimenk,"We feel good when people believe in us and make us feel useful and valuable. It’s a human trait we all have. But the truth is, relying on people will only bring about disappointments. People will let you down. Remember, your value and self worth comes from the Almighty!"
3195,2018-09-20 14:45:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Let it go. The things that have happened in the past, the things that aren’t happening right now, let it go. If you want to move on, stop looking back on your past. That part of your life is over. If you want to see the light, stop holding yourself in the darkness of your past."
3196,2018-09-20 07:09:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you know that we judge others because we’re insecure? When we judge, we are often projecting something we don't want to feel about ourselves or something that we feel is missing in our own lives. Think about this the next time you’re tempted to pass judgement!"
3197,2018-09-19 15:25:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop dwelling &amp; brooding over things that haven’t worked out. Accept what happened, acknowledge how you feel about it, then put it behind you and move on. Remember, it’s all part of the Almighty’s Plan. You can’t change the past, but you can surely change the future! #GodWilling"
3198,2018-09-19 03:55:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Be mindful of your old habits. Don’t go back to them. Remember, toxic behaviour and negative energy have a way of creeping back into your life when you’re doing better. Make a conscious effort to boot them out once and for all. Be firm. Be focused."
3199,2018-09-18 20:49:15+00:00,muftimenk,Someone did you wrong? Learn to let it go. The truth is they will ruin more of your life if you allow them to invade your mind like a virus. This will in turn affect the quality of your life. The best thing to do is to move on. Show that you’re strong enough to take control.
3200,2018-09-18 07:58:14+00:00,muftimenk,"It doesn’t matter if you’ve made mistakes. We all do. You don’t need to carry around labels or mistakes from yesterday as if they define you. Whatever’s done, is done. It’s over. It doesn’t have to brand you and affect the new choices you're making today. Go forward."
3201,2018-09-17 16:22:10+00:00,muftimenk,"We have literally become obsessed with taking photos and videos of ourselves and others. It’s just another way of separating our lives that we show off on social from reality. Somehow, our devices have become our vices; they've begun to control our lives!"
3202,2018-09-17 03:31:25+00:00,muftimenk,Remember you’re not a burden. You’re not worthless. The Almighty made you and you’ve every right to be here. Don’t ever feel that the world would be better off without you. Everyone struggles. Everyone will fall apart at some stage. ⁠ ⁠Do your best and leave the rest to Him.
3203,2018-09-16 16:51:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Be serious about your repentance. The one who’s truly remorseful is the one who is regretful of his past sins. He has a deep fear of falling into them again. And more importantly, he stays away from bad company and those who are likely to encourage him to sin again."
3204,2018-09-16 06:09:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, attitude is everything. You have a choice daily as to how you react to things. The bulk of what happens during the course of your day depends largely on your reaction. Have a positive attitude and see how your morale increases and things get better! Choose right!"
3205,2018-09-15 22:16:38+00:00,muftimenk,Your journey is yours alone. There’s no need to look right or left to see who’s cheering you on or who’s celebrating you. Quit worrying about who’s not on your side. Keep your focus on the road ahead. You’ll get there just as the Almighty has planned it for you!
3206,2018-09-15 11:22:32+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to say no to people who mess with your head. The ones who keep doing things intentionally to upset you. The ones who always play the victim even though it’s obvious they’re wrong. The ones who expect you to prioritise them but won’t do the same for you. Avoid them!
3207,2018-09-14 19:43:18+00:00,muftimenk,"You should know by now that people will speculate, they’ll think the worst of you, they’ll judge, assume, gossip &amp; backbite. When told the truth, most won’t even bother to correct themselves. Such is the state of humankind today. Protect yourself. Stay away from such sinful acts!"
3208,2018-09-14 03:36:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, protect us from the evils of this world. Grant us strength and good patience to cope with our trials. Help us surrender to Your Decree because You know what we don’t. You know what we need. You know what’s best for us!"
3209,2018-09-13 14:28:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Each day that you spend with negative thoughts, crying over what others may have done to you, feeling hopeless and that life is meaningless, is a day wasted. Pick yourself up. Learn to energise yourself. Be positive. Be strong. Be hopeful. Don’t give up on life!"
3210,2018-09-13 03:31:21+00:00,muftimenk,You may wake today thinking it’s going to be the most difficult day to get through. But the Almighty knows you’ll get by just fine. The pain will ease and the hurt will pass. It’s because nothing lasts in this world. He has promised better days ahead.
3211,2018-09-12 13:26:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Your heart is the most important organ in your body. Guard it with your life. Don’t give it to just anyone. Protect it from hatred, jealousy etc. Nurture it. Imbibe it with what’s good. Your heart will get what it prays for. Don’t think the Almighty is not aware of your heart!"
3212,2018-09-12 07:19:26+00:00,muftimenk,"It's wrong to think that your life means nothing. The Almighty has created you for a reason and instead of thinking bad and low about yourself, you must strive towards finding your purpose and why He has created you. Be confident but don’t let it turn into arrogance and pride!"
3213,2018-09-11 19:24:19+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re tempted to share something on social media, investigate before you do. Anything you post comes from you, which means you’re responsible for it’s accuracy, even if you got it from somewhere else. Things can come back to haunt you in the most unimaginable way. Be wary."
3214,2018-09-11 04:01:10+00:00,muftimenk,"You've got to be patient in this journey called LIFE. It will make you, it will break you. You’ll meet people along the way who will render help &amp; those who will leave you by the wayside. But if you keep asking the One who made you, He will never disappoint. So never stop asking!"
3215,2018-09-10 21:45:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do, always have the right intention. Do it solely for the sake of the Almighty and watch how He opens doors you could never have imagined before. Remember, He can make the impossible, possible. Miracles do happen. Trust Him!"
3216,2018-09-10 04:43:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the toxic ""friends"" who will never compliment you. They'll never have a good word or congratulate you on your achievements. In fact, they're much more likely to kick you when you're down. It’s always about them. They’ll drain you of all your energy! Keep your distance!"
3217,2018-09-09 13:35:43+00:00,muftimenk,"We often hear people cursing their fate, wondering why it’s always them who have to suffer. Why is the Almighty always testing me? Why is He rewarding those who sin with more wealth? The truth is each one of us is tested differently. He knows what He’s doing. Press on!"
3218,2018-09-08 20:30:32+00:00,muftimenk,"All the wealth you painstakingly amass will remain here. You won’t be able to take one single thing with you. Always remember this. What are you gaining really, and at what price? Are you sacrificing your Hereafter for some glitz &amp; glamour of this world that many call luxury?"

3220,2018-09-08 08:21:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Money is important, for sure. But you don’t have to go crazy over it. The Almighty has written it down for you, there is no need for you to lie, cheat, deceive, resort to fraud practices, abuse the rights of others just to make some extra bucks. Greed doesn’t pay!"
3221,2018-09-07 16:40:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be frustrated. Be patient instead; with the Almighty and with yourself. Don’t be in such a rush. We often expect His schedule to be the same as ours! It rarely works that way. We’re in a hurry. He’s not. Remember, He’s always on time. Not a moment earlier or later!"
3222,2018-09-07 06:32:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray that You keep us on the straight path.  Protect us from being misled from all the lies and trickery of this world. Show us the truth as truth and allow us to follow it; and show us the wrong as wrong and allow us to avoid it! Aameen"
3223,2018-09-06 22:08:01+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want something, you can’t just sit back &amp; do nothing; you have got to work for it. When you have put in effort, exhausted your brains on how to tackle a certain problem, then rely on the Almighty for the results. If it’s meant for you, it’ll be yours!"
3224,2018-09-06 09:31:39+00:00,muftimenk,"People ask why do bad things happen to good people while all that’s good goes to the bad ones? If you dig deeper, you’ll realize that whatever happens in your life is according to the Almighty’s plan. It’ll always work out for you, be it in this world or the next! Be patient!"
3225,2018-09-05 20:35:43+00:00,muftimenk,"There will be temptations in life. But keep your heart firm on what is favoured by the Almighty. Keep yourself away from His displeasure.  He is the Provider. If you remain firm in faith, following His way, He will provide for you from sources you wouldn’t even imagine existed!"
3226,2018-09-05 07:34:10+00:00,muftimenk,Those you do good to will not only forget what you’ve done but many of them will go out of their way to harm you at some stage. It's the Almighty’s way of testing whether you were kind to them for His Pleasure or for your benefit.
3227,2018-09-04 19:16:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Many people crop, tweak, add filters &amp; manipulate their images to present an impression of how they want to be perceived. Separating reality from the online image can be tough. Often, young people end up looking harshly at themselves as a result. They think they’re failures!"
3228,2018-09-04 09:39:37+00:00,muftimenk,"Why do we lie? Is it because we’re afraid of displeasing people? Or do we lie in order to appear to be better than we really are? Examine the heart. Whatever the reason, work on it!"
3229,2018-09-03 20:19:06+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty will give you what you need to get through every difficulty. You just have to lay your trust in Him. Pray for the best solution and the Best Planner will show you the way out!
3230,2018-09-03 13:34:30+00:00,muftimenk,There is a huge pull on you to conform to the ways of the world. You’ve got to stand strong and firm. Rise above that which is prohibited by the Almighty. Rise above the darkness! Don’t give in. The choice is yours.
3231,2018-09-03 04:35:49+00:00,muftimenk,The trouble with most people is that they call on the Almighty only after they’ve called everybody else; this is the wrong order. He’s your Creator. He knows you better than anyone else. He knows about your problem before anyone did. So let’s change the order &amp; seek Him first.
3232,2018-09-02 13:14:11+00:00,muftimenk,"The better you are, the more successful you become, the bigger you get, the more you’ll be criticized or just have nasty things said about you or even to you; anonymously online. It usually stems from jealousy. Don’t waste time responding!"
3233,2018-09-02 04:01:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Train yourself to remain polite even in the most difficult situation. Stand your ground firmly but politely. Let them curse &amp; swear. Choose to rise above cheap, verbal abuse which is widespread today. Sooner or later they’ll realize their mistake &amp; how offensive they were!"
3234,2018-09-01 14:31:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyone wants to succeed in life but only a few will be truly happy for your success. The truth is, people will generally only support your goals and dreams until you make it &amp; end up doing more than them. Sadly, they want to see you do good, but never better than them!"
3235,2018-09-01 04:42:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be fooled and let the world tell you that when you win, you show immense strength. No. Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. The more you’ve gone through hardship and trials, the stronger you become!"
3236,2018-08-31 22:20:32+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re set on revenge and want to pay someone back, bear in mind that your actions will hurt you, not them. Learn to rise above it all. Revenge may give you a temporary high but it’s not worth it in the long term because you’re made for bigger and better things!"
3237,2018-08-31 11:06:39+00:00,muftimenk,"When you go through a difficult situation, be it the inevitable death of a loved one, the loss of a job or a mild health problem, take a deep breath and remember, nothing lasts. The Almighty won’t burden you beyond your capabilities. He’s the Only Source of Strength. Trust Him!"
3238,2018-08-31 01:30:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, purify our hearts so that we don’t end up being people pleasers. Help us to realise that our original intent of doing things is to please You; not the rest of the people. Keep us focused so we don’t end up neglecting our duties towards You!"
3239,2018-08-30 12:19:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Hiding pain under a smile is not easy. It can be one of the hardest things to do. You do it when you care about others more than you do for yourself. But remember, a smile can hide so much.. fear, pain, sadness, tears. But they reflect one main thing. Strength!"
3240,2018-08-30 01:21:11+00:00,muftimenk,Don't live in regret. The past is over. Today is a new day; you are not the same person you were before. Believe that today will be better than yesterday. It’s about looking up with hope and looking forward. Look for new opportunities that the Almighty  has planned for you.
3241,2018-08-29 16:57:22+00:00,muftimenk,Remind yourself that the Almighty doesn't just tell you to do something; He guides you through it. Part of it includes getting you to be in the right place at the right time. He puts different people in your life at different times. You just have to surrender and trust Him.
3242,2018-08-29 06:38:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful when choosing the kind of people you want to surround yourself with. The ones you trust the most may actually be trying to bring you down. Remember,  the saddest thing about being betrayed is that it doesn’t usually come from your enemy!"
3243,2018-08-28 20:15:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't let people manipulate your mind, feelings and emotions or control how you think about yourself. No one should be allowed to do that. Your thoughts are your own. It’s the most powerful thing  you have. Never give that power to someone else!"
3244,2018-08-28 13:24:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Instead of crying over missed opportunities, closed doors and detours, pause and think. It’s the Almighty’s way of protecting us from the pain and anguish not meant for us. Had He allowed it, we would have been left broken and in total despair!"
3245,2018-08-28 04:07:56+00:00,muftimenk,"It is no secret that even the strongest person gets tired at times. But that’s where patience, prayer &amp; positivity play a big role. Without any of that, you’d probably have called it quits. Keep your strength &amp; hope in the Almighty. He will reward those with beautiful patience!"
3246,2018-08-27 20:42:41+00:00,muftimenk,"We are an impatient lot. We stress ourselves out wondering when and how our goals will come together. The truth is, it’s of no use because only the Almighty knows when it’s the right time for everything to fall into place. So quit worrying and simply trust Him!"
3247,2018-08-27 04:46:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to the Almighty. So why do we feel a sense of superiority? May He remove arrogance from our hearts and teach us to be humble, always remembering Him in all that we do!"
3248,2018-08-26 21:19:48+00:00,muftimenk,"We all make mistakes. Don’t give up just because you made a mistake. The Almighty knew the mistake way before it ever happened. Instead of feeling miserable and depressed, pray. Ask Him to ease your affairs. Stop focusing on the past and keep moving forward."
3249,2018-08-26 10:20:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Train yourself not to stress over negative comments made about you on social media. In fact, don't respond. People hide behind their screens to release their frustrations. Their mean words &amp; baseless allegations say more about them than anyone else. Don't lose sleep over them."
3250,2018-08-25 22:08:41+00:00,muftimenk,The real test of sincerity is to see whether a person will help you even if he knows he will get nothing in return from you. The truth is anyone can help when there’s something to gain in return; but to help when there’s nothing to be gained shows true love &amp; a beautiful heart!
3251,2018-08-25 14:01:08+00:00,muftimenk,"We’ve all felt like a failure at times. But don’t drown in that feeling. Remember, the battles you’ve won, the setbacks you’ve overcome, the trials you’ve gone through. The Almighty promised that nothing would last. Keep hope alive &amp; carry on. He’s always watching over you!"
3252,2018-08-25 06:58:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Each time we're hurt, we tend to blame others. It's always someone else's fault. Don’t fall into that trap. Learn to be accountable. Take charge of your life and your own shortcomings. The Almighty knows the truth. Don't play the blame game."
3253,2018-08-24 19:06:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Pray for those who are struggling with difficulties that no one knows about. They hide it from the world, always smiling and people think they're actually happy. Only their faith in the Almighty keeps them going. May the Almighty grant them a way out!"
3254,2018-08-24 15:37:21+00:00,muftimenk,"I would like to congratulate His Excellency @edmnangagwa on his recent victory. We pray for harmony, stability and peace which will bring about the recovery and growth that we so desperately need in this wonderful country. All the best Cde President!"
3255,2018-08-24 04:49:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, make us steadfast in our prayers &amp; acts of worship done solely for You. Grant us humility &amp; submission always, never showing off or feeling that we’re more pious than the person next to us! Protect us from being arrogant &amp; never to judge others!"
3256,2018-08-23 19:55:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful how you react to those who’ve wronged you. Two wrongs do not make a right. You can’t be mean, angry or bitter &amp; expect good in return. Don’t wrong others the way they’ve wronged you. Be the better, kinder person always. Your reward is with the Almighty!"
3257,2018-08-23 08:11:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people will go out of their way to lie like it’s the only truth. They mislead the unsuspecting without batting an eyelid. Be careful of fake news, false information &amp; lies disguised as the truth. Always verify important information. Don’t believe everything you hear or read!"
3258,2018-08-23 02:48:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to walk away from people and situations that threaten your peace of mind, self-respect, values, morals or self worth. Don’t argue with them. Don’t get into a debate with them. It’s not worth your effort. It’s also a sign of maturity."
3259,2018-08-22 16:31:59+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the one who doesn’t retaliate when you wrong him. Instead, he raises his hands to the heavens and seeks help from the Lord of the Worlds; the most powerful! Be careful not to hurt others. If you do, quickly seek forgiveness."
3260,2018-08-21 21:28:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Wishing you a Blessed Eid-ul Adha. Eid of the Sacrifice of Prophet Abraham pbuh. Spare a thought for the less fortunate as you celebrate with family and loved ones! 
#EidMubarak #SelamatHariRayaKorban"
3261,2018-08-21 13:25:53+00:00,muftimenk,We don't need to celebrate #Eid on the same day to show unity. Unity is achieved by respecting the differences we have &amp; celebrating them. Don’t fling insults &amp; verbal abuse at those you disagree with. Show restraint &amp; tolerance. That will bring about true unity. #LoveYouAll
3262,2018-08-21 03:20:47+00:00,muftimenk,"This life is short. 
Make it a point to touch lives and hearts whenever you get the opportunity. Give, forgive and  apologise. If you find difficulty doing it, make a commitment and start on this day of Eid. Channel your energy to things that matter. #EidAlAdha"
3263,2018-08-20 09:48:46+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what difficulties you’re facing, know that the Almighty has your back. He’s there even when things seem hopeless. He’s there even when the circumstances are darker than you ever imagined. He's there when everyone has given up on you. Place your trust in Him."
3264,2018-08-20 04:59:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. As the pilgrims gather in #Arafah on this Great Day of #Hajj, we pray that You grant them ease &amp; accept their acts of worship. May it be a day of total forgiveness for all. Aameen."
3265,2018-08-19 20:11:39+00:00,muftimenk,"What do we lack in life? We have practically all the basic necessities and more. Sadly, most of us tend to look at the few things we don't have &amp; become depressed &amp; despondent. Be careful because the Almighty doesn’t like ingratitude. He can take away anything, anytime..."
3266,2018-08-19 08:14:48+00:00,muftimenk,Some people firmly believe that we must not show kindness towards those of other faiths. This is a serious misconception. Treat all humans fairly. It is our duty to do so. May our actions always be in line with whatever pleases the Almighty!
3267,2018-08-18 21:33:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything is the way it is for a reason. You’ve got to believe it. You’ve got to trust the Almighty’s plan for you. Whatever’s going on in your life, the journey continues. Nothing comes to a standstill. Have faith that it will all work out in the end!"
3268,2018-08-18 13:18:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is we’re becoming dissatisfied with what we have, what we see and do because, as soon as we go online, we see someone who has achieved, seen or done something better. Or at least, that’s how they’ve made it look. Don’t let social media ruin your life!"
3269,2018-08-18 05:08:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't bother with negative comments, insults &amp; harsh words others throw at you. Nobody knows you better than the Almighty. It’s your Creator you should be trying to please. Let Him be the judge. It doesn’t matter if you’re not everyone’s cup of tea. Some prefer other beverages."
3270,2018-08-17 23:05:08+00:00,muftimenk,"At some stage, the Almighty closes doors because it’s time to move on. The trouble is we may not see this. He knows what He’s doing. He also knows that you won’t move unlesss He creates some discomfort for you! Change is never easy! Trust Him."
3271,2018-08-17 16:02:13+00:00,muftimenk,Don't waste time engaging in sin. You have the chance to start anew every day when the Almighty returns your soul to you after sleep. It’s up to you to decide today how you want to live your life; in His pleasure or displeasure. You have a duty to fulfil. Make it a good one!
3272,2018-08-17 09:53:32+00:00,muftimenk,"On this blessed day, may the Almighty grant ease to the people of #Kerala who are experiencing massive flooding, apparently the worst in living memory. May He protect their lives and keep their homes safe from further damage. Aameen"
3273,2018-08-17 00:04:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Look back on your life &amp; think; did the Almighty not bring you through some tough times? Those difficult days you never thought you would emerge from and see the light? Not only did He get you through them, He also taught you how to do better the next time; so stop worrying!"
3274,2018-08-16 10:25:53+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with us today is we love to pick on people, jump on their failures &amp; criticize their faults. We do it with such passion like it’s a natural pastime. Bear in mind that it could all come back to us at any time. What goes around, comes around."
3275,2018-08-16 00:24:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever you start thinking you’re such a big deal, you’ve arrived in life, you’re more superior than the next person, think of this... you’re truly nothing but a share of this earth! Humble yourself always!"
3276,2018-08-15 11:27:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Thank the Almighty for all the times He allowed you to learn things the hard way, only to remind you that He will always be the answer you need. There’s no reason to complain, whinge or whine to others about what you’re going through. Confide in Him!"
3277,2018-08-15 05:35:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Before you start commenting on whatever someone may be going through, have the sense to put yourself in that person’s shoes. Empathy is key. Be aware, be sensitive to others’ feelings, needs and concerns. Remember, life is not always about me, myself and I."
3278,2018-08-14 23:38:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Much of our frustration, anxiety, worry &amp; depression comes from the fact that we try to control things we simply cannot control. Have faith that it will work out, yes, but don’t force it to happen the way you see it happening. It will happen when the Almighty says it’ll happen."
3279,2018-08-14 16:18:04+00:00,muftimenk,"We are all broken in some ways. Bring your wounded heart to the Almighty. He will restore you. There are many people who are suffering from things they can't tell anybody, but you can cry out to Him, and talk to Him about everything. He knows you, and He cares about you."
3280,2018-08-14 08:01:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Being kind to family members is a good thing. But at the same time, we need to take care of ourselves so that we can have a healthy mindset in the long run. If your mental health is suffering from the effects of toxic family members, you should protect yourself from harm."
3281,2018-08-13 19:31:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes, we don’t realize that we’re praying for a situation that is far worse for us than what we are in at the moment. So the Almighty, through His Mercy, keeps it away from us &amp; we keep thinking our prayers are not answered! Remember, His favours are countless!"
3282,2018-08-13 10:04:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Never tire of doing good. People will take you for granted after a while. They’ll forget to thank you and acknowledge you. It will hurt but remember that at the end of the day, your reward is with the Almighty and no one else. That thought alone should keep going!"
3283,2018-08-13 00:06:59+00:00,muftimenk,We all make mistakes. Everyone of us. No exception. The Almighty has planned it in great detail. Sometimes it takes a very big mistake we make in life to transform us into the best of people. So learn to take mistakes in your stride because it’s not the end of the world.
3284,2018-08-12 14:33:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have such friends; honest, sincere people who don't pretend to be perfect. They’re not harsh or judgemental. They will stand up for you behind your back and won’t backstab. They're not so common but they exist. You’re blessed if you have them in your life!"
3285,2018-08-12 08:00:15+00:00,muftimenk,"You don’t meet people by accident. The Almighty puts different people at different times in our lives for a reason. Sooner or later you’ll find out why they were a part of your life. Some will stay, some won’t. Some will strengthen you, others will test you. That’s His Plan!"
3286,2018-08-12 00:46:32+00:00,muftimenk,It's easy to wallow in self pity and look at everything that’s wrong in your life. Try this instead. Pray to the Almighty for a  fresh start in any area of your life. Let go of the old and that which is bad for your heart. Start anew. Receive the blessings He has prepared!
3287,2018-08-11 15:53:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember if you don’t nurture your faith, it will slowly weaken and leave you grappling with doubt. Satan will jump in at the slightest opportunity &amp; create havoc in your minds, leaving you heedless. So protect yourselves before your hearts harden."
3288,2018-08-11 08:48:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Your journey will often be distracted by people’s opinions. Don’t let it consume you. Be honest with yourself. Purify your intention. It makes it easier for you to handle what others think. Besides, it’s not your reputation the Almighty is after. He looks at your integrity."
3289,2018-08-10 20:09:48+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to distinguish truth from tale. It’s a must to verify important news and information thoroughly because people lie to get ahead in life. They don't care if you suffer as a result of their mind games. Don’t fall into their trap &amp; end up regretting it. Be alert!
3290,2018-08-10 08:14:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Never forget that the Almighty is more merciful to you than you are to yourself. Stop beating yourself up over past mistakes which you can’t change. Instead, focus on your future because no matter how badly you’ve messed up, it’s your end that matters!"
3291,2018-08-09 23:58:30+00:00,muftimenk,"On this blessed day, may you get what you have been praying for. May all your supplications be answered. May every tear that has fallen down your cheek because of worldly disappointments be equivalent to the best rewards in Paradise. Aameen."
3292,2018-08-09 08:12:34+00:00,muftimenk,"When we don’t fully understand the attributes of the Almighty, that’s when we start feeling hopeless. Never forget He’s the Most Merciful, Most Forgiving. No sin is too great for Him. So never feel you’re not deserving of His Mercy. And don’t make others feel hopeless too!"
3293,2018-08-08 22:22:07+00:00,muftimenk,Some people refuse to accept the fact that you’ve changed. They keep harping on the “old” you. They refuse to see you in a new light. They can’t stop talking about your past mistakes and wrongs. Ignore such people. Time to let them go!
3294,2018-08-08 07:04:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, people will only drive you crazy if you allow them to. So don't let your anger spin out of control. If someone is irritating you, recognise those feelings and then let them go without saying much or getting into conflict. You don’t need to respond to everything."
3295,2018-08-07 21:21:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Delays, disappointment and detours are all part of the Almighty’s Plan. You have to understand that. Valuable lessons will be taught along the way. You should try to learn as many of them. Not only will you emerge stronger, you’ll also be grateful for all He’s put you through!"
3296,2018-08-07 11:46:12+00:00,muftimenk,Life is such that you’ll keep facing trials and storms. Obstacles and hardship. There’s no running away from them. But don’t let all that affect your inner peace. Accept the Almighty’s Decree. Understand His Plan. He will keep you rooted and peace will prevail in your heart!
3297,2018-08-06 21:52:06+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty knows the best solutions to our problems. We just need to pray more &amp; seek His assistance and Him alone, not anyone else. Complaining to others &amp; stressing over our problems will not solve it. Keep asking Him. He will respond!"
3298,2018-08-06 12:26:03+00:00,muftimenk,#Earthquake in #Lombok #Indonesia. We feel your pain. We share your grief. We stand by you. May the Almighty protect you and grant you ease. Aameen
3299,2018-08-06 08:40:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Unless you’re really close to someone, you can’t use their outward appearance to judge the reality of their life. People carefully select what they want to show you. Don’t be fooled because you don’t actually know what goes on behind closed doors in the lives of others!"
3300,2018-08-05 20:44:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop doubting how far you’ve come, regretting your choices &amp; putting yourself down. Satan will make you think otherwise. His job is to make you miserable and depressed. Don’t cave in. Stand firm. Always encourage, support and believe in yourself. That’s the way forward!"
3301,2018-08-05 09:27:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Tell yourself often that things will work out in the end, no matter what’s happening now.  Always bear patience, trust that the Almighty knows what’s going on. Don’t let worry, fear and anxiety get the better of you. Ease will come, sooner rather than later!"
3302,2018-08-04 21:43:22+00:00,muftimenk,The truth is nobody will truly understand what you’re going through except the Almighty. He’s the only One who knows your true circumstances and is always available when you need Him. He will heal you  and make you whole again!
3303,2018-08-04 08:51:06+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to rejoice and celebrate the victories of others. It will open doors of goodness in your own life in return. Be gracious enough to accord even your enemy their due place. Such positive actions will lift you up even during your worst days!
3304,2018-08-03 22:12:25+00:00,muftimenk,I would like to extend my congratulations to our President @edmnangagwa on his victory in the Zimbabwe Presidential Elections. May the Almighty guide you to do what’s best for the people. I wish you every  success in performing the important &amp; responsible duties of this position.
3305,2018-08-03 19:19:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Whenever a door closes in your life, the Almighty is trying to tell you to move on. Move forward. Don’t look back. He’s guiding your steps. You’ve got to trust Him. Change is never easy. The unknown can be unsettling. But He’s the Owner  of your sustenance; so why worry?"
3306,2018-08-03 06:31:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, may we never forget that You’re the Turner of Hearts. You can heal us in a moment. You can forgive in an instant. You can make the impossible a reality! May we always be ever grateful for everything! Aameen."
3307,2018-08-02 19:12:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't let people from your past carry on hurting you today. Let go of any grudges you hold against them in your heart. The past is the past. That part of your life is over. The best thing to do is pray, move on and leave the rest to the Almighty."
3308,2018-08-02 09:53:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Many people have a habit of accusing others blindly. A blame without proof remains a mere blame. When there’s no concrete evidence, nothing carries weight. It remains a mere accusation. It doesn’t become fact! Don't be fooled."
3309,2018-08-02 04:25:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t draw your own conclusions when you’ve only heard half the story. Listen to the entire story in order to make an informed decision and fair judgement. Above all, be fair!"
3310,2018-08-01 15:26:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Violence is not the solution nor is it the way forward. Keep a level head when confronted with events that provoke you. Never retaliate because the result can be damaging, causing much regret. Above all, be mature over how you react to things. Let common sense rule."
3311,2018-08-01 08:50:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't let your dislike for someone lead you to be unfair, unjust, vulgar and rude. Perhaps, the Almighty sees them as being better than you!"
3312,2018-07-31 22:19:48+00:00,muftimenk,"What we say about others says more about us, who we are and what we stand for. Be careful how you comment. Don’t be rude. Be civil. Be courteous. Be polite."
3313,2018-07-31 13:27:38+00:00,muftimenk,Never underestimate what the tongue can do. You may think it’s just a muscular organ in the mouth but life and death are in the power of the tongue. Words can be medicine or poison. They can heal or kill. Don’t misuse your tongue.
3314,2018-07-31 02:38:30+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is we’re always too busy speaking our mind that we forget to listen to what’s being said. One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to someone else’s viewpoint. Try to be a good listener. Unlike your mouth, your ears will not get you in trouble."
3315,2018-07-30 16:20:19+00:00,muftimenk,Peaceful day in Zimbabwe. We continue to pray for goodness. Aameen #CastedMyVote #respectall #ZimbabweElections #ZimDecides2018 #ElectionsZW #ZimbabweDecides #ZimbabweDecides2018 #Zimbabwe #BuildingBridges #muftimenk https://t.co/YqktEBepET
3316,2018-07-30 14:49:10+00:00,muftimenk,"The time will come when you look back in wonder at how everything has changed. Everything in place just the way you had imagined. Remember the Almighty’s promise? After hardship, there’ll be ease. Don’t forget to thank the Most Merciful."
3317,2018-07-30 10:21:30+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter who emerges the winner in this election, we must all respect the outcome. We must do our best to uphold the values of peace &amp; harmony, love &amp; kindness. This is the only way forward and to ensure continued positive growth. #ZimbabweElections #ZimDecides2018 #ElectionsZW"
3318,2018-07-29 18:54:34+00:00,muftimenk,"This world is a taker. It will take as much as you can give. It will never tire of taking. The more you give, the more it wants. You’ll be left weary &amp; depleted. That’s the nature of this world and what it stands for. Remember, givers must have boundaries because takers do not!"
3319,2018-07-29 14:41:12+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty, as we go to the polls, guide us to make the wisest decisions. Grant us peace, stability, prosperity, goodness, love, kindness and respect. Bless us with whatever You know is best for us. Aameen #PrayForZimbabwe #ZimbabweElections"
3320,2018-07-29 04:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,The bottom line is you really can’t count on people to motivate you and build you up in life. The truth is everyone is so caught up in  their own lives that they have little or no time for others. Learn to encourage yourself but don’t leave the Almighty out of the equation.
3321,2018-07-28 19:25:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Keep going. No matter what you do, no matter how many times you mess up, no matter who says you can’t do it and there’s no point in carrying on, just carry on. Keep at it. Don’t quit. Remember, a month from now you’ll be that much closer to your goal!"
3322,2018-07-28 05:36:27+00:00,muftimenk,"How you live will determine how you respond to difficulties. When your heart is attached to this world, it will look for worldly means to relieve it from its problems. But when your heart is attached to the One who made it, you’ll turn to the Almighty in the first instance!"
3323,2018-07-27 16:51:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty, we are attacked moment by moment with images on television, the internet, books and newspapers that leave us vulnerable to sin of every kind. Protect us from all things evil. Cleanse our hearts, &amp; strengthen us so we’re able to face the Devil even better than before."
3324,2018-07-27 05:19:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us strength to overcome the difficulties that we’re facing now. Protect us against problems we may encounter in future. Bring us together as we’re meant to be. May the love that binds us grow stronger as we fulfil what You’ve laid out for us. Above all, forgive us!"
3325,2018-07-26 23:19:29+00:00,muftimenk,Don't think your value is related to how much you have amassed. Never judge your self-worth by your net worth. You came into this world with nothing &amp; you’re not taking anything material out of it. Life’s not about the wealth you’ve acquired. It’s about the bonds you’ve forged!
3326,2018-07-26 14:36:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Stop thinking you’re a failure just because things are not going your way. Instead of worrying, pray. Turn to the Almighty &amp; pour your heart out. Let Him know your concerns. Let Him give you a sense of purpose. He will steer your heart in the right direction. Trust Him."
3327,2018-07-26 05:19:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Be patient with yourself. We've all been hurt &amp; learnt painful lessons. But each time, we pick ourselves up &amp; move on with quiet confidence. This is what beautiful patience is about. It doesn’t complain, knowing the Almighty’s in full control of everything. Relief will come soon!"
3328,2018-07-25 21:13:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't let your biggest enemy lie to you. Satan will trick you into believing that things aren’t going to change &amp; that you’re doomed for life! That’s what He will keep replaying in your mind. Remember, no matter what you’re facing, in an instant, the Almighty can turn it around."
3329,2018-07-25 12:26:40+00:00,muftimenk,"We hear this being said often enough. Life is not always fair. But bear in mind that the Almighty is always fair! He knows what He’s doing. All the pain, disappointments, tears, they won’t go to waste. He’s All Seeing. He will take everything into account and reward you."
3330,2018-07-25 04:45:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Make someone happy today. Do a good deed. Be kind, even to a stranger. Spread goodness. Smile. Do whatever it takes. Just do it. Happiness never decreases by being shared. Let us spread it far and wide!"
3331,2018-07-24 21:34:33+00:00,muftimenk,"When you want something badly, confide in the Almighty. There’s no need to tell others about your plans. One of the best ways to do it is to talk to Him when the world sleeps; in the depths of the night, away from distractions of the waking hours. Ask from your heart. Sincerely."
3332,2018-07-24 11:52:04+00:00,muftimenk,I often wonder how people have the time to look for mistakes in others while overlooking their own flaws. They’re not bothered with correcting themselves. They engage in dissecting the faults of others to the smallest detail and feel quite content telling it freely to others!
3333,2018-07-23 14:59:59+00:00,muftimenk,"When you do things purely for the Almighty, you’re driven by your heart. You don’t worry what others have to say.  It’s the complete opposite for the hypocrite who is driven to please others and what they’ll say. Keep your intentions pure and do things for the right reason."
3334,2018-07-23 04:57:15+00:00,muftimenk,"A definite recipe for unhappiness is to listen to what others have to say about you. In fact, you can't be at peace till you learn to ignore the gossip and the unkind words hurled at you. If they have an agenda, nothing can stop them. The Almighty is on your side. Turn to Him."
3335,2018-07-22 14:12:20+00:00,muftimenk,"It takes a mature person with a special heart to actually say that no matter how much someone hurts me, I'll still pray for him. It’s not easy. Most of us will actually do the reverse and start cursing &amp; swearing the person when this happens. But such people do exist. Blessed!"
3336,2018-07-22 03:59:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is such that there’ll always be people who will misunderstand you and people who won’t like you. Don’t fret. Youre not in a popularity contest. Each time you’re criticised or put down, you can deal with it firmly but politely or leave it to the Almighty to defend you."
3337,2018-07-21 20:00:38+00:00,muftimenk,"We do this without even thinking....we keep planning  and moving on in life, often never stopping to reflect on what we’re blessed with and how far we’ve come. We rush through life as if tomorrow is guaranteed. Learn to embrace life’s moments and thank the Almighty. Do it now!"
3338,2018-07-21 14:00:50+00:00,muftimenk,"The trouble with many is to turn to others at the first signs when things go wrong instead of confiding in the Almighty. We have to learn to trust Him. Trust when we’re in messy places, when we’re sure we’ve made mistakes. No one is going to lift you out of your woes but Him!"
3339,2018-07-21 00:20:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Problems come and go. Don’t let your problems take over your whole thought process. You have to consciously manage your thoughts and remind yourself that the Almighty is in control. He can change whatever He wills, whenever He wills. Put your trust in Him."
3340,2018-07-20 11:14:21+00:00,muftimenk,"In a world that’s obsessed with physical beauty, always ask the Almighty to beautify and uplift our soul through consistent acts of worship and prayer. Remember, time will rob you of your outer beauty, no matter how hard you try to preserve it but a beautiful soul remains!"
3341,2018-07-20 08:19:10+00:00,muftimenk,"In the last seven months, our country #Zimbabwe, has seen positive change &amp; growth. While we thank the Almighty for this, we must acknowledge the people He chose to deliver it to us. Thank you @edmnangagwa for your sincerity, honesty &amp; integrity. You're an inspiration! #ED"
3342,2018-07-20 05:13:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, protect us from sins of our own tongues. Make us stay away from gossip &amp; uttering words that tarnish someone’s honour dignity &amp; reputation. Distance us from those who love to indulge in such acts. Help us speak only good words or remain silent."
3343,2018-07-19 22:47:38+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want something, knock on the Almighty’s door. If you want something badly, keep knocking, harder each time. Don’t let up. You’re not asking just anyone but the Lord of the Worlds. The Master of Miracles. He already knows what you want. He wants to see how sincere you are!"
3344,2018-07-19 15:41:59+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in such an impatient society. Everything has to be quick, instantaneous, fast, in a hurry. Sadly we also expect the same from the Almighty when we pray,  asking Him to fulfil our wishes. We forget that He has His own timing. So wait patiently!"
3345,2018-07-19 04:11:09+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let this world blind you with selfish dreams and delusions in your heart. Know that none of that will last. It will only bring you darkness and pain in the end. Turn towards the Almighty and let Him guide you and light your way!
3346,2018-07-18 18:48:44+00:00,muftimenk,Remember everyone has untold stories of pain and struggle. There’s no exception. That’s what makes our lives different from one another. That’s why we need to be more understanding and compassionate towards others. Stop judging!
3347,2018-07-18 07:07:23+00:00,muftimenk,"There's nothing perfect about this life. The mess you make, the delays, the things you don’t understand, they’re all part of the Almighty’s Plan for you. He’s worked out every bit of the puzzle. Your job is to bear good patience as you go through it. You’ll see the full picture!"
3348,2018-07-17 21:07:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Always be mindful. Although judgment is a natural instinct, check yourself before you speak, or send that nasty email and do any potential harm. You can’t undo what you’ve done. Pause. Try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Put yourself in their shoes!"
3349,2018-07-17 07:05:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Once you’ve built a good relationship with the Almighty, you’ll always be filled with hope and confidence. You’ll  always have good thoughts about Him. You’ll begin to realize that He is greater than any situation you will ever encounter."
3350,2018-07-16 22:12:28+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel stuck in any situation, be careful who you listen to in the midst of what you’re going through. There will be negative voices. The ones who will hurt you and would rather see you stay down. Remember, the Almighty won’t forsake you. No matter what others say."
3351,2018-07-16 13:47:55+00:00,muftimenk,"When life gives you something that disturbs your peace and comfort, don’t be sad. Sometimes, curveballs are actually a blessing in disguise, even if it's hard for you to see that during times of uncertainty and change. Trust the Almighty. He’s working on something better!"
3352,2018-07-16 05:57:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Sometimes it’s necessary to distance yourself from certain distractions in your life to concentrate your time, energy and effort into things that matter the most. Don’t be afraid to do that. Your true friends will allow you that space and respect you. Go for it!"
3353,2018-07-15 19:32:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is social media makes us impatient. It rushes us to want what someone else has, to be the person you see on your timeline, to live someone else’s life. Don’t let this happen. Learn to be content with what you have. Learn to appreciate the person that you are."
3354,2018-07-15 05:51:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Senseless killings and acts of violence in #Pakistan #Palestine #Syria #Yemen #Iraq #Afghanistan #Kashmir &amp; the likes must stop. Nothing can justify these horrific, inhuman acts. May the Almighty guide us all to peace, justice &amp; respectful coexistence."
3355,2018-07-14 21:33:28+00:00,muftimenk,"You're stronger than you think. You have cried, prayed, sacrificed, been through the storm and rain and had to endure so much to get to where you are! The Almighty knows how much you can handle. With each passing experience, you’ve moved one notch up! You’re blessed!"
3356,2018-07-14 15:06:32+00:00,muftimenk,Don't try to figure it all out. You won’t be able to. You’ll end up confused and disappointed. Don’t overanalyze. You won’t be able to see the full puzzle. Do what you know the Almighty wants of you. The full puzzle will unravel sooner or later. Trust!
3357,2018-07-14 04:47:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't just pray because you want the Almighty to give what you’ve asked for. Pray because you want to strengthen your relationship with Him. Pray so that when life gets hard, you’re more prepared to respond well because of your link with your Creator."
3358,2018-07-13 21:02:24+00:00,muftimenk,The amount of suffering going on around us has reached unprecedented levels.  It’s a fact that we are better off than so many people in the world. Yet we complain. Our struggles are small compared to others. Count our blessings before the Almighty takes everything away!
3359,2018-07-13 06:55:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Many times you may feel that in your life, there is a lot of waiting. You wait for things to happen. In the process, you can either grow frustrated or you can grow in patience and strength. May the Almighty grant us the ability to wait patiently for what He has in store for us!"
3360,2018-07-12 20:47:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Has it occurred to you that each time you pray, it could be your last? So take your time and develop a no rush policy when praying to your Creator. May the Almighty be pleased with us and have Mercy on us all, the day He decides to take us."
3361,2018-07-12 13:03:47+00:00,muftimenk,"What the Almighty has given, no one can take away. What He has denied, no one can give. You have to understand His Plan. You have to stop worrying unnecessarily about such things because it’s not within your control. So call out to Him and Him Alone!"
3362,2018-07-12 04:31:55+00:00,muftimenk,Learn not to be affected by what others have to say about you. People will talk. You can’t control them. Take control of yourself instead. There’s only one version of you so be the best you can. The Almighty knows what lies in your heart. That's all that really matters.
3363,2018-07-11 20:38:06+00:00,muftimenk,Unfortunately #ItsNotComingHome...
3364,2018-07-11 16:47:02+00:00,muftimenk,"When there’s no pain, there’s no gain. The truth is behind every successful person, there’s a painful story of grit, determination &amp; the will to succeed. The painful story has a beautiful, successful end. Remember, the pain is part of the process. Embrace it. Success will follow!"
3365,2018-07-11 06:07:51+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to look past the behavior of toxic and irritating people. The truth is they are hurting; that’s why they choose to hurt others. They are full of fear and insecurity. Ignore the hate that they spew. Respond with patience and love. Say a prayer for them.
3366,2018-07-10 17:30:26+00:00,muftimenk,"We all cry. Yes, we do. Not just children, adults too. If we don’t do it openly, we cry deeply in our hearts. It provides a huge sense of relief. Often we try to be strong for those around us. But sometimes it gets overwhelming. So cry your heart out. You’re not alone!"
3367,2018-07-10 04:34:21+00:00,muftimenk,Don't ever think that you’re stuck in any circumstance. Nothing is too difficult for the Almighty. Hold on fast to your faith. It’s a matter of time before you see the light at the end of the tunnel! The breakthrough will come!
3368,2018-07-09 16:54:52+00:00,muftimenk,"It's a dangerous practice to overlook your small sins. You may think they’re small but to the Almighty, they’re massive. Like pebbles, sins do add up and soon turn into mountains. Imagine finding out on Judgement Day that you have several of these mountains. Be mindful!"
3369,2018-07-09 06:47:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Foolish is the one who chases fame. It's greed for attention. It won’t last. If addicted to it, you feel you’re always on display, you have to act differently to different people and can't be 'real'. You crave publicity and want your experiences to be  recognized by all."
3370,2018-07-08 16:30:42+00:00,muftimenk,"It's never easy to hide pain under a smile. The truth is, it's very difficult. Only selfless people can do it. The ones who care about others more than they do themselves. So be kind to all around you, no one knows what inner turmoil each one is going through."
3371,2018-07-08 05:40:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember that your character  should always be stronger than what you’re experiencing in life. We can’t always control what happens to us, but we can always control how we react and respond to it. Instead of complaining, choose to give thanks for all the good in your life!"
3372,2018-07-07 22:02:40+00:00,muftimenk,Looks like #ItsComingHome ...
3373,2018-07-07 21:37:46+00:00,muftimenk,We've all had those days when nothing makes sense. That’s when you need to trust the Almighty even more. Build a strong foundation of trust and apply in all aspects of your life. It is a quality that will remain sufficient for you in matters of this life and the Hereafter.
3374,2018-07-07 13:07:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Take the spite out of your heart. Purify it. Your heart is a small organ. When you fill it with hatred for someone, you’re preventing it from being filled with the love of the Almighty. Always ask Him to protect us from hearts that are consumed with hatred, envy and the like."
3375,2018-07-07 06:55:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because someone smiles always doesn’t mean his life is perfect. It’s a sign of faith, hope and strength. It’s a sign that yes, nothing lasts and things will get better. The Almighty is with us every step of the way. Satan will make you doubt that. Don’t!"
3376,2018-07-06 20:20:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you think you’re pious doesn’t give you the right to fall into the trap of being a harsh, judgemental and unforgiving person. Check yourself for these traits. While you ignore these sins which you’re committing, who knows if they’re working on those sins of theirs?"
3377,2018-07-06 04:54:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, may we not see illness as a cause of despair. Help us to use the opportunity to turn to You for Mercy and Healing. We beseech You to remove the illness, cure the disease. You are the one who cures. There is no cure except Your cure."
3378,2018-07-05 21:32:42+00:00,muftimenk,"We all struggle. Some of us more than others. There’s nothing wrong in admitting that we do. It makes us human. Life is not a walk in the park. Life is hard. It is also beautiful. You’ll feel happy and sad. Hurt and joy. Whatever you do, be real and keep friends who are real too!"
3379,2018-07-05 08:03:10+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is people will scar you. Yes. Even loved ones. And when that happens, the wounds are among the deepest. Instead of hanging on to negative thoughts, think of the good they’ve done to you. It’s not easy. It needs a conscious effort. Ask the Almighty to help you let go!"
3380,2018-07-04 19:40:00+00:00,muftimenk,"When you can remain calm no matter what test the Almighty puts in your path, it shows that your  faith in Him is unshakeable. The peace you display shows that you acknowledge the fact that He is bigger than all your problems put together. You know He won’t let you down!"
3381,2018-07-04 04:04:03+00:00,muftimenk,Do not borrow money or get a loan just so you can purchase luxuries to impress others. This is bad practice.  We should all live within our means. Always seek refuge from the Almighty from debt and related activities!
3382,2018-07-03 20:16:42+00:00,muftimenk,Always live in hope. Always believe that what lies ahead  of you is so much greater than what you’ve left behind. Think good of the Almighty and you’ll see positive things unravel before your eyes. He will show you things you’ve never imagined possible! He can and He will!
3383,2018-07-03 12:29:12+00:00,muftimenk,"It's sad that many forget to count their blessings when we have such a Merciful Lord. He loves us unconditionally and is always waiting for those who’ve wronged themselves to turn back to Him. So no matter how far you think you’ve deviated from His Path, call out to Him."
3384,2018-07-03 05:53:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, you’re not adding any value today by worrying about tomorrow! Take it one step at a time, one day at a time. No one knows what tomorrow holds. Trust His Plans and don’t let worry rob you of the precious moments which will pass and never return!"
3385,2018-07-02 22:32:41+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty takes something away from you, it’s because He has big plans for you. For some, giving them more blessings will distance them from Him. For others, hardships can distance them from Him. He knows best how you’ll react to every situation. So trust Him always!"
3386,2018-07-02 07:57:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is too short to waste in the company of those who can’t wait to put you down. Let them say what they want. Their opinions aren’t your problem. Keep doing good as you’ve always done. No matter what they do or say, don’t doubt your self worth!"
3387,2018-07-01 23:21:10+00:00,muftimenk,Never be content with how pious you think you are compared to others. Never judge your journey too soon. The Controller of Hearts will test your faith again and again; whether your words match your action. Always ask the Almighty to keep your heart firm in faith.

3412,2018-06-23 10:02:24+00:00,muftimenk,Being at peace is everything. It’s not just a feeling. It’s a way of life. It shows in everything that you do. It shows how close you are to the One who made you. It shows you’ve surrendered to the Almighty &amp; accept everything that He has decreed. It’s the most powerful thing!

3419,2018-06-20 13:45:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Your faith will be tested again and again. It’s easy to believe when things are going your way, when the path is rosy. But the true test comes when the Almighy puts obstacles in your way. Do you become disobedient &amp; defiant or do you submit to Him, be patient and ride it out?"
3420,2018-06-20 04:11:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Notice that those who are doing good work usually work in silence, often ignoring the noise made by others. The drama, the haters and the negativity will always be there. Ignore all of that. Let your success speak for itself."
3421,2018-06-19 19:22:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't have too many friends. Your inner circle should be people who remind you of the Almighty and who draw you closer towards Him.

3439,2018-06-13 17:02:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember on Judgement Day, the Almighty will weigh your deeds &amp; not count them. He’s not interested in the numbers. He looks at how much heart was in what was done. Who went out of their way to do it solely for Him and who did it to show off?"
3440,2018-06-13 02:45:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. As #Ramadan is about to end, we ask You to keep us steadfast and to carry on worshipping You with the vigour we showed in the blessed month. Choose for us what’s best. Help us succeed in this life and the hereafter. Almighty,  forgive us and grant us Paradise."
3441,2018-06-12 14:25:56+00:00,muftimenk,Those who succeed eventually are the ones who don’t get discouraged when things don’t work out initially.  They know the Almighty’s in control. They don’t allow a setback to bother them. They trust that it’s His way of setting them up for something bigger and better!
3442,2018-06-12 03:12:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't take anything for granted because you never know when you'll have it for the last time. Life is a precious gift, cherish every moment. It’s truly such a blessing to be alive and to be able to impact so many lives. You’ll never know whose life you’re touching."
3443,2018-06-11 18:02:50+00:00,muftimenk,"If you don’t want to be disappointed, keep this in mind. Be prepared to have the most unexpected people let you down. It’s bound to happen at some stage. Amid all this, be yourself and spread goodness as much as possible but don’t expect goodness from everyone."

You don’t need people’s approval to fulfill what the Almighty has decreed for you. His approval is all you need in this life and you’ll know it in your heart because it feels right!
3445,2018-06-10 22:15:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Always remind yourself that everything in this world is temporary. People come &amp; go. Feelings change constantly. Places don’t last.

3446,2018-06-10 14:04:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Marriage is a lot about give and take and sacrifice. It will fail if you start competing with your spouse. It’s not about who’s the stronger person. It’s about who’s willing to compromise and do more to make the other happy. Remember, it’s the little things that go a long way."
3447,2018-06-10 04:14:13+00:00,muftimenk,Take time off your busy schedule often &amp; reflect on your life. It’s so easy to get caught up in this worldly web that we often forget where we’re headed.

3448,2018-06-09 20:08:51+00:00,muftimenk,"How can we possibly give up hope in the Almighty’s Mercy? In fact, to give up hope is an insult to Him of the highest magnitude. He has more Mercy than all of the creation combined and it will not diminish His Mercy if He shows it to the entire creation."
3449,2018-06-08 20:25:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Nobody said this life would be easy. There are many pitfalls along the way.

3451,2018-06-07 17:09:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Those whose hearts are attached to the Almighty don’t waste time looking at what everybody else is doing, what others have &amp; what’s going on in their lives. Such people mind their own business. They’re too busy focusing on what He has put in their lives to bother with others."
3452,2018-06-07 03:05:07+00:00,muftimenk,Make a commitment to start a new beginning when #Ramadan ends. Give up at least one bad habit in this blessed month. Do it solely for the Almighty. All the good we have done should not come to an end with the end of the month. Hold on to them and start anew!
3453,2018-06-06 13:06:15+00:00,muftimenk,"You see a huge obstacle in front of you but you forget that the greater the trial, the bigger the reward. Don’t be discouraged by what you see. The Almighty won’t test you beyond your capabilities. Stay firm. Out of your struggles, your faith will emerge stronger than before!"
3454,2018-06-06 03:04:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Remain polite at all times. Even if you disagree with someone, there are ways to do it respectfully. There’s no need to resort to name calling, cursing, abusive and foul language. There’s no justification to mock and insult others. Remember, leave the judging to the Almighty."
3455,2018-06-05 21:54:24+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty may seem to have closed certain doors in your life but in actual fact, He’s waiting to see how persistent you are and how much you want that something. Perhaps a push in the form of a supplication might just open it! Be sincere in your intent. Try it!"
3456,2018-06-05 12:52:40+00:00,muftimenk,"In the blink of an eye, we’re already in the last ten nights of #Ramadan. Thank the Almighty for them.

It’s a gift from the Almighty to be able to tell right from wrong. Beware the dead heart that is numb; it keeps sinning repeatedly and doesn’t feel an iota of guilt!"
3458,2018-06-04 16:18:18+00:00,muftimenk,"You have a choice. You can either stress over what you’re going through or you can do your best given the circumstances and pray for the best outcome. What’s done is done. Pray about it. You don’t know what the future holds, pray for it. Whatever your situation, pray!"
3459,2018-06-04 04:48:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Look at those who have less than you in worldly matters. Don’t look at those who have more than you. Only then will you be grateful.

3460,2018-06-03 21:40:17+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want to change, start by setting small goals from today. Change won’t happen overnight. It takes time but if you strive and show the Almighty you’re sincere, He will pave a way for you!"
3461,2018-06-03 09:10:35+00:00,muftimenk,"In this age of social media, it’s almost second nature for some to do good deeds and then show off to the world what they’ve done. Don’t! Try to keep it low key. Share it only with the Almighty. No matter how small it is, to Him it could weigh heavily on your scales!"
3462,2018-06-02 23:12:44+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in a society that is so judgemental. People will form their own conclusions of you based on a tweet or a status. They judge you on your appearance or even your accent. Just because you’re different from them, they look down on you. Stand your ground firmly but politely."
3463,2018-06-02 12:24:16+00:00,muftimenk,Don't run after those who’ve left you. Don’t be distracted by their departure. They’re gone for a reason. They have served their purpose. It’s part of the Almighty’s plans to bring new people into your life. He’s worked it all out so just go with the flow.
3464,2018-06-01 23:38:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, you don’t need people’s approval to be happy. If they have issues with you, it’s not about you, it’s about their insecurities. You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. Let it go or you’ll end up frustrated. Get your approval from the Almighty."
3465,2018-06-01 03:01:23+00:00,muftimenk,"As we enter the halfway mark in #Ramadan, take stock of how you’re progressing. It’s never too late. The most crucial thing is to finish strong as we enter the last ten nights. Keep going. The Almighty knows and sees all your efforts, no matter how small. He will reward you."
3466,2018-05-31 20:30:48+00:00,muftimenk,"There are some people who, no matter how good you are to them, it won’t make them good to you. That’s just the way they are.  Don’t stress over such people. They exist. Spread your goodness no matter what the circumstances. Nothing good is ever wasted. The Almighty’s All Knowing."
3467,2018-05-31 03:05:47+00:00,muftimenk,"There are some who criticize others all the time. They’ve nothing good to say and just keep mentioning the faults of others. They’re like houseflies, which love trash and dirty places. They have a lot  of hatred and evil within themselves. They need help!"
3468,2018-05-30 11:06:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't put off till tomorrow what you should do today. When you have the “one day” attitude, you’ll miss out on what the Almighty has planned for you today. You refuse to see what He’s dangling in front of you, right here, right now. Don’t end up the loser!"
3469,2018-05-30 05:23:31+00:00,muftimenk,Many chase their desires at the expense of obeying the Almighty. How can you forget that all that you’re chasing comes from Him? How can you disobey Him so blatantly and expect all your prayers to be answered? Don’t take things for granted. Show gratitude. He will give you more!
3470,2018-05-29 20:08:29+00:00,muftimenk,Let us be honest. This world is full of distractions; too many things vying for our attention. Discipline yourself to focus on what matters. Let go of those things which don’t. Have an “Almighty-first” mentality. Don’t just fit Him in. He’s right at the TOP.
3471,2018-05-29 12:30:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't make light of your sin, no matter how small you think it is. Instead, reflect on it. Think of The One you've disobeyed. Seek His Mercy. If you keep procrastinating, you’ll slide deeper and deeper into sin. Repent today!"
3472,2018-05-29 03:46:13+00:00,muftimenk,We expect the Almighty to fix all the mess we make. He's the Creator of Miracles and the Best of Planners. Yet we don't correct our mistakes. We repeat them! Let this #Ramadan be our turning point where we strive to put right all aspects of our life.
3473,2018-05-28 13:30:55+00:00,muftimenk,"There are things in life, no matter how much you hang on to them, that aren’t meant to stay. So change may not be what you want but it’s what you need. Change is difficult but deciding to make the change may be the best thing for you. Seek the Almighty’s help and guidance always."
3474,2018-05-28 05:50:42+00:00,muftimenk,"When life gets difficult and nothing seems to go your way, you can either get bitter or accept it and do your best. Bitterness keeps you stuck in the present situation. Let it go. Choose to move forward and keep positive, knowing that the Almighty has your back. Always!"
3475,2018-05-27 21:58:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Always trust the Almighty unconditionally. Remember, He made you. He knows everything about you. Don’t try to figure out everything on your own. You won’t be able to anyway.  Pour your heart out to Him. Make Him your priority and He will keep you on track. Get Him on your side."

3477,2018-05-27 11:10:08+00:00,muftimenk,Part of the evening prayers at the Grand Rashidiyyah Masjid in Dubai last night. @iacaddubai #Subhaanallah https://t.co/IQPDRY2kwV
3478,2018-05-27 09:12:16+00:00,muftimenk,"We're all perfectly imperfect! Don’t expect things the way you want it or the way you think it should happen. It won’t be like that. And don’t be too hard on yourself for not being perfect. Remember, if the Almighty had wanted us to be perfect, He would have made us angels!"
3479,2018-05-27 00:07:31+00:00,muftimenk,"An important lesson to remember - people you help, won’t necessarily help you back, even when you need it most. They’re not obliged to; but we expect them to! Instead, get your inner peace &amp; contentment from your good deeds. If any good  comes back to you, it’s a bonus!"
3480,2018-05-26 10:44:47+00:00,muftimenk,"You may be in the depths of despair at the moment but remember, storms don’t last forever. They can shake you to your core. But they will pass. The Almighty has promised us, with hardship comes ease. So the rain will stop eventually and you’ll find peace after the chaos."
3481,2018-05-25 23:10:31+00:00,muftimenk,"It's easy to just blurt out what you feel in the heat of the moment without any regard for others. But always remember, that it takes only a few seconds of hurtful words to penetrate deep into someone’s heart and they may take years to heal, if at all!"
3482,2018-05-25 15:07:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't do things out of fear of what others will say. You’re not answerable to people but to the One whom made you. Fear Him. Not His creation. Do things for His sake. Attaining sincerity with the Almighty is a journey, not an overnight process. Ask Him to help purify your intent."
3483,2018-05-25 08:10:38+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. There’s nothing more we want in this life than a good death. A death where You’ll be  pleased with us. Take us only when we’re  in that condition. Help us to live this life in a way that pleases You. Keep us on Your Straight Path. Aameen.
3484,2018-05-24 18:48:46+00:00,muftimenk,Let go of your past. Don’t let it get to you. You’ve repented and moved on. The Almighty has forgiven you. Be kind to yourself. Focus on what’s happening right now and know that He’s keeping a close look out to ensure that everything falls  into place.
3485,2018-05-24 07:37:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Respect other people’s time. We often have a very selfish attitude towards time in that we expect everyone to adjust their schedules around us but we won’t let anyone mess our day. Stop being self-centered &amp; inflexible. Remember, what you give out, you will get back. Eventually!"
3486,2018-05-23 22:30:15+00:00,muftimenk,"In difficult times, it’s even more important than ever that you focus on the Almighty, with firm thoughts of faith. Be in the company of good, positive people who will spur you on with hope and encourage you.  Stay away from the negative ones who will only bring you down."
3487,2018-05-23 09:16:20+00:00,muftimenk,"It's easy to complain about others but when we do this, we’re actually telling people about our own flaws as well. Learn to keep quiet unless you’re saying something truly out of kindness. Furthermore, it’s #Ramadan; so speak good or not at all."
3488,2018-05-22 22:14:30+00:00,muftimenk,Why is it so hard to forgive and rid your heart of the grudge and hatred. Will any of this matter when you’re in your grave and when you’re at the mercy of the Most Merciful? Let this #Ramadan be the healing that you need from all the dieseass of the heart. Don’t wait!
3489,2018-05-22 13:18:15+00:00,muftimenk,"This #Ramadan, make a firm commitment to use words to build people up.  Stop using foul language and bad speech. Words are powerful. They leave a lasting impact. So let nothing else but good come out of your mouth. The effects will resonate far and wide."
3490,2018-05-22 07:15:02+00:00,muftimenk,"In your darkest moments, when you feel that life is unfair and everyone has abandoned you, you have to remind yourself that the Almighty is always there. Remember, nothing will help you to reach Paradise except going through hardships with utmost patience and His Mercy."
3491,2018-05-21 23:17:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Every day is a new beginning. It is the Almighty’s Mercy that you’re given another day, another #Ramadan. Stay away from what might have been and move on. Don't let negative words and actions of others affect you. Decide that today is going to be a good day. Live it!"
3492,2018-05-21 12:20:42+00:00,muftimenk,"Trials are given to test our faith. But it can be difficult not to look at someone &amp; think that they have it easier than we do. Break away from that mentality. We can let our trials break us, make us bitter, or we can let it refine us &amp; make us stronger. The choice is yours!"
3493,2018-05-21 01:23:52+00:00,muftimenk,"In your darkest moments, when you feel that life is unfair and everyone has abandoned you, you have to remind yourself that the Almighty is always there. Remember, nothing will help you to reach Paradise except going through hardships with utmost patience and His Mercy."
3494,2018-05-20 14:18:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty doesn't make mistakes in His Plans. Every hardship you’ve experienced has served to make you the person that you are today. There are valuable lessons in everything that happens to you. Stop asking why it happened and focus on how you should respond."
3495,2018-05-20 06:39:32+00:00,muftimenk,"We are mostly guilty of this; just rushing through our day and saying, “What’s next?” We have a mental checklist we need to get done and we don’t have time to stop and appreciate the Almighty’s many blessings. Stop and thank Him for life and for every breath you take!"
3496,2018-05-19 23:44:36+00:00,muftimenk,"This #Ramadan let us remove what doesn’t feel right in our lives. The Almighty knows our weakness and He knows how prone we are to committing sins. Speak to Him about your troubles. If you’re sincere in seeking His help, He will show you exactly how to return to Him."
3497,2018-05-19 15:19:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't get drawn into arguments, petty squabbles and quarrels in #Ramadan. These sins may take away all of the reward and you’re left with nothing but merely hunger and thirst. Remain silent and dignified. The best best way to respond is to say, “I am fasting.”"
3498,2018-05-19 07:38:20+00:00,muftimenk,"For many people, their darkest days are normally the ones that get them closest to the Almighty. Their most profound experiences of worship will be when they’re on the brink of giving up; when they feel there are no options. Let’s change that and make Him our top priority always."
3499,2018-05-18 21:55:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember #Ramadan is a month where the Doors of Mercy are wide open. So don't waste the opportunity. Repent sincerely. Now's the right time. Engage in self-reflection. Ask the Almighty to give us more patience  and compassion, to reboot our faith and cleanse our soul."
3500,2018-05-18 11:45:01+00:00,muftimenk,Read the signs when the Almighty’s telling you to move on. Don’t put a question mark where He has put a full stop. It’s not in our capacity to fully comprehend all that’s going on. But know that He will heal the pain and mend the heart!
3501,2018-05-17 22:45:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't think #Ramadhan is for perfect souls. Seek the Almighty in whatever state you’re in; those in pain, the broken-hearted, those whose spirits are crushed. If you’ve taken that first step towards Him, know that He will come to your rescue each time!"
3502,2018-05-17 15:07:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Never think that the Almighty has forgotten about you. He’s All Knowing. He has seen the tears, the heartache and pain. None of it will be wasted. He will pave a way out for you and you’ll be stronger than before. Be patient!"
3503,2018-05-17 04:42:04+00:00,muftimenk,Be kind to the person who made you feel small and tried to belittle you. It will cost you nothing. Be known for your compassion; touch others with your exemplary character and conduct. You’ll end up the winner!
3504,2018-05-16 21:28:02+00:00,muftimenk,"The problem with us is that we tend to focus on what we don’t have. Train our minds to look at the positives. Our health, intellect, family &amp; loved ones, wealth &amp; so on. Satan is a genius at making us feel ungrateful. No matter how tough our day was, don’t fall into his trap."
3505,2018-05-16 14:06:51+00:00,muftimenk,"The crescent clearly visible in my photograph taken over the #Maldives moments ago. My beloved brothers and sisters, have a blessed month of #Ramadhan. From #MuftiMenk https://t.co/o29IwVViH4"
3506,2018-05-16 09:40:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Not only is #Ramadan a month of Mercy &amp; Forgiveness, it’s also a month of supplication. Don’t give up calling out to the Almighty for your needs. He hears. When the time is right, He shall bestow. Pray that He keeps away what is bad for us, no matter how desperately we want it."
3507,2018-05-16 05:09:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Whether you have sighted the moon or not, I wish you all a blessed #Ramadan, filled with goodness and positive growth. May it be a month of reflection and introspection. Aameen"
3508,2018-05-15 19:20:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Not everyday is smooth sailing. There will be bumpy rides and life can get uncomfortable.  Although you can’t see what's ahead of you, know that the Almighty is always working and preparing you for what’s to come. Trust the process!"
3509,2018-05-15 08:33:38+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let this world dictate to you what beauty is. A beautiful figure &amp; fair skin don’t mean anything if you have a bad heart. Beauty is not what people see when they look at you; beauty is what they discover when they find out what is inside of you.
3510,2018-05-15 03:49:57+00:00,muftimenk,"#PrayForGaza. It is ablaze with some of the worst, unprecedented violence in recent years. Many have lost their lives. Thousands are wounded. #StopTheBrutality"
3511,2018-05-14 12:55:54+00:00,muftimenk,"I am deeply saddened by the turn of events in #Surabaya. It is totally unacceptable. Terror has no religion, race or colour. My heart goes out to the victims and all affected. May the Almighty grant ease to all Indonesians."
3512,2018-05-14 09:06:22+00:00,muftimenk,"It's only human to feel frustrated and dejected when things aren’t going your way. You feel like you’re carrying the weight of the world on your back. Sometimes we think the Almighty is not answering our prayers, but He is answering them; just not doing it the way we want."
3513,2018-05-13 23:09:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Hypocrites love to gossip, they love to know what everyone else is doing; their in’s and out’s. They may even make up gossip if it’s not juicy enough. It can be hurtful and upsetting when you are the subject of the untruthful gossip. Confront them peacefully and pray for them!"
3514,2018-05-13 09:30:51+00:00,muftimenk,"At times we are so afraid of disappointing the people we love, that we often forget ourselves and our needs as well. Remember, we need love, compassion, kindness and goodwill just as much as others do."
3515,2018-05-12 19:03:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Choose your battles. If you really want to correct someone’s unacceptable behaviour, be prepared for the worst. Not everyone will accept being told they’re wrong. You may end up much more embarrassed than them. Perhaps it’s best to just pray for them."
3516,2018-05-12 08:44:23+00:00,muftimenk,Learn to exercise patience in everything that you undertake. Patience is your capacity to tolerate delay; basically to wait. It is trusting that the Almighty will not let you down. He knows what He’s doing; no matter how long it takes and no matter what your purpose may be.
3517,2018-05-11 23:34:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Seek peace and avoid conflict. This is a mark of honour in a person. When you give up arguing and crossing swords with others, especially when you’re right, you’ll be singled out by the Almighty. Be prepared for the bountiful blessings that await you."
3518,2018-05-11 15:08:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't fret over what’s going on. Nothing lasts. Know that the dark days will give way to days of laughter, days where you will see the sun peeking out again. And gratitude will pour from your mouth because of what the Almighty has done to pull you through it all."
3519,2018-05-11 07:05:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't waste precious time on things that will not bring you closer to the Almighty. Actions that do not contain benefit for yourself or those you interact with in general, are wasted actions. Always be mindful to spend your free time wisely. You’ll never get it back!"
3520,2018-05-10 23:52:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Make us conscious of You, be it in secret or in public. We ask You to make us speak only the truth in times of pleasure and during anger. We ask you to make us mindful of the blessings you’ve given us and may we never take them for granted."
3521,2018-05-10 16:34:12+00:00,muftimenk,"The preparators of the gruesome attack on a Mosque in Verulam, South Africa must be brought to justice. Such barbaric attacks are unacceptable. No matter what our differences, resorting to physical harm or killing is never an option. #respectall #interfaithharmony #DurbanAttack"
3522,2018-05-10 09:18:41+00:00,muftimenk,Everything happens for a reason. It’s easy to be grateful when things are smooth sailing but it gets more difficult when faced with life trials. Reflect on your experiences and you’ll realize how much you’ve learnt from them all. They’re part of the Almighty’s plan.
3523,2018-05-10 00:36:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty is only a call away. Talk to Him about your dreams, your goals. Tell Him everything. Confide in Him rather than in people because He will never betray your trust. He will show you a way out of every difficulty if you’re patient &amp; willing to learn."
3524,2018-05-09 14:04:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, you’re not at the mercy of other people. Why do you waste your time worrying about what others will do? They can’t stop what is meant for you; what the Almighty has decreed for you. Go forth happily knowing He’s got your back. Trust Him."
3525,2018-05-09 06:52:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Start cleaning up your act in preparation for the blessed month. Get rid of anger, envy, hatred, malice, slander, gossip, obscene talk swear words and the likes from your mouth. Make a commitment to never let them back into your life. Seek the Almighty’s help. Be sincere."
3526,2018-05-08 21:29:13+00:00,muftimenk,"You should know by now that not everyone wants to see you succeed. Many out there would rather see you fail, your dreams shattered and be in a state of distress. It’s sad but it’s the harsh reality. Be careful who you share your plans, goals, and dreams with."
3527,2018-05-08 07:58:31+00:00,muftimenk,Don't be foolish and start comparing yourself with others. It will rob you of your inner peace and you’ll find yourself heading down the slippery road of envy and jealousy. The truth is you’re unique. The Almighty created you to do things that no one else was created to do!
3528,2018-05-07 22:58:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful when you’ve hurt someone deliberately. If you’re guilty, apologise as soon as possible. Don’t hesitate. May the Almighty protect us from being the source of pain and tears in someone else's life! May He forgive our sins and shortcoming!"
3529,2018-05-07 08:03:08+00:00,muftimenk,Being quiet and gentle doesn’t mean you’re weak. Such people show strength that’s under control. It’s knowing when to speak and when to listen; when to take action and when to wait. Don’t underestimate such people. They walk with the greatest strength!
3530,2018-05-06 19:45:32+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think the road is long. You keep falling. You depend on Him &amp; only Him to help you up again. This is part of life. The Almighty has promised it won’t be easy. He’s testing the level of your conviction &amp; courage; that quiet voice in you that’s says, “I’ll keep trying”."
3531,2018-05-06 17:49:00+00:00,muftimenk,"I can't believe they made me sing! I guess there is a first for everything. Or for some things at least. Not bad for a beginner... looooool. Blessings and Salutations upon the Prophet Muhammad pbuh.

3532,2018-05-06 02:56:47+00:00,muftimenk,"People worry about falling in love, finding real love &amp; so on. They forget that the Almighty is the real source &amp; owner of love. Attach your heart to Him &amp; things will fall into place. When you attach it to what He has disallowed, be prepared to be heartbroken &amp; miserable!"
3533,2018-05-05 18:52:52+00:00,muftimenk,"People will only show you what they want you to see. Remember, everyone has a chapter in their lives where they don’t read out loud. So don’t be fooled by the “perfect front” that people put up on social media. You’d be foolish to believe all that."
3534,2018-05-05 08:08:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Think of positive things. Don’t think of who offended you, who betrayed you, who took you for granted &amp; what didn’t work out. Such things are bound to happen in life. Instead, think of the goodness the Almighty has bestowed on you and how fortunate you are!"
3535,2018-05-04 22:44:32+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, what is not said is the more powerful message that you need to be more aware of. The one who says “I’m fine” but has eyes full of tears. The one who smiles because she’s too sad to cry. Remember, even the strongest  people have their breaking points. Be kind always!"
3536,2018-05-04 14:31:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Beware the tricks of Satan. He  causes people to procrastinate, become lazy and delay doing good deeds. He makes a sinner put off repenting, indulging in his desires, telling him that one day he could repent, but not now because he will sin again! Don’t fall for such tricks!"
3537,2018-05-04 06:16:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, forgive us for those times when we were facing problems and we were so quick to become discouraged or depressed, forgetting how you’ve never let us down. No matter what comes our way, we will put our trust in You. We know You’ll see us through!"
3538,2018-05-03 22:31:35+00:00,muftimenk,Not all battles are worth fighting. Simply walk away from those who disrespect you by lying. The best response to such people is no response at all. There’s no need  to divulge everything you know. Any confrontation usually leads to more lies. So leave it be. The Almighty knows!
3539,2018-05-03 12:44:40+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people find it so hard to apologize when they’ve done wrong. It’s to do with their pride. You can never get them to say  sorry, no matter how obvious their mistake is. Beware such pride, even the size of a mustard seed will not let you smell Paradise."
3540,2018-05-03 02:47:22+00:00,muftimenk,"There are too many people criticizing others, pushing them down, looking for their faults and dooming them. Be the positive force who tries to push them up, motivate them, see the best in them, offer words of encouragement and lift them up."
3541,2018-05-02 14:14:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing that happens in your life is random. Everything is planned by the Best of Planners. Every failure, every closed door, every stumbling block, every success, every disappointment has all helped make you into who you are today. Thank the Almighty for everything!"
3542,2018-05-02 04:04:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the more you talk about the negative things going on in your life, the more miserable you become and in fact you will worsen the situation. Commit yourself to talk of positive things and overlook the negative. Thank the Almighty for having brought you this far!"
3543,2018-05-01 14:24:28+00:00,muftimenk,"How someone looks on the outside doesn't determine their worth.  We need to look at what’s inside: their kindness, generosity &amp; character.  Next time you hear others mocking the way someone looks, don't encourage it. Don't feel the need to add your own comments. Put a stop to it!"
3544,2018-05-01 08:00:06+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, not everyone will treat you the same way as you treated them. That’s the harsh reality. Those who disappoint you are not blind; they’re just too busy to see &amp; appreciate what you’ve done for them. So don’t expect anything from others. Your reward is with the Almighty."
3545,2018-04-30 21:49:41+00:00,muftimenk,"When you give others a sincere compliment, words of encouragement or just a warm smile, you are making their world a better place. You are making them feel appreciated and valuable. You will feel more fulfilled because you have done something to make someone else’s life better."
3546,2018-04-30 08:44:01+00:00,muftimenk,"If they respect you, respect them. If they disrespect you, still respect them. If they’re mean to you, be kind to them. If they curse and swear in your presence, offer a good word to them. Don't allow their bad actions to affect your good manners. Rise above them."
3547,2018-04-29 23:17:44+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, there are many out there who act like they are experts in the lives of others. The ones trying to throw stones at other people are not perfect. In fact,  only those who have to hide bad things throw mud at others, to turn the attention away from themselves."
3548,2018-04-29 16:32:57+00:00,muftimenk,It's natural to feel frustrated when things are not going your way. But don’t let it get to you. Understand the Almighty’s plan when that happens. Look for the positive lesson you’re meant to be learning from it. Have a good attitude &amp; you’ll end up happier.
3549,2018-04-29 06:45:46+00:00,muftimenk,"When you pray for others, it shows your heart is pure. Especially when you pray for  people you don’t know. And they may never know. But your one prayer can make a world of difference for them. So keep praying and spreading goodness because you never know who’s praying for you."
3550,2018-04-28 21:35:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be sad just because someone did something bad to you, lied to you or betrayed your trust. Being upset will not change anything nor will it undo what has happened. Let it go. Keep a light heart and trust that the Almighty will take care of things."
3551,2018-04-28 14:34:47+00:00,muftimenk,You'll encounter many people who aren’t really what they seem. They have hidden agendas. They make themselves feel better by putting others down. They achieve a position of power or prestige at the expense of others. They love to control other people. Go far away from them!
3552,2018-04-28 08:05:38+00:00,muftimenk,"You don’t have to win every argument. You don’t need to have the final say in everything. It’s your ego at work and you need to tame it. Make a decision to let go of the need to control, the need to be approved and the need to judge. Focus less on yourself!"
3553,2018-04-27 22:09:12+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve reached a stage in your life where you can remain calm when a calamity strikes, you have certainly matured spiritually. It shows you have complete faith in the Almighty and you know that nothing lasts. No matter what happens in life, it will pass eventually."
3554,2018-04-27 05:53:57+00:00,muftimenk,"How can you lose hope when you know the Almighty is handling your affairs? He will handle your troubles, your stresses, your sickness and everything that afflicts you and make you whole again. For as long as you believe in Him and only Him to turn your troubles around."
3555,2018-04-26 23:49:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray for the helpless, the hopeless and those who are hurting. Everywhere we look, there’s chaos in the world. Make their load easy and their burden light. Give them hope when they’re tempted to become discouraged or depressed."
3556,2018-04-26 14:05:27+00:00,muftimenk,Why is it we often find ourselves treating our loved ones so badly? Yet we treat outsiders well. We’re always conscious of portraying a good image. Take time to reflect on what life would be like without the ones you love. This should set you back on track. Show gratitude.
3557,2018-04-26 06:44:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, not everyone is like you. If you’re the type who keeps to time, doesn’t procrastinate, means everything you say and walks the talk, don’t expect others to behave in the same manner. You’re setting yourself up for a huge disappointment if you do."
3558,2018-04-25 22:25:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Even when you don’t understand what’s going on in your life, you have to trust the Almighty. He’s taken you there for a purpose. Keep praying. Keep asking for guidance. If you’re sincere in getting answers, He will unravel His Plans before your eyes. Get ready to be amazed!"
3559,2018-04-25 14:28:18+00:00,muftimenk,It takes a lot of courage to stand alone &amp; be yourself. It takes a lot of courage to be different. It takes a lot of courage to not compromise your faith.  Some will try to make you feel like a freak for not standing with the crowd. That’s ok. Listen to your heart!
3560,2018-04-25 04:03:52+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel guilt in your heart after you’ve sinned, be grateful. It’s the Almighty’s way of telling you to repent and do good. He’s offering you a way out after you’ve gone against what He has prescribed. That’s His Mercy!"
3561,2018-04-24 20:35:52+00:00,muftimenk,"You may have been praying and asking the Almighty to get you out of a situation but know that He may not grant you a way out for a reason. Perhaps, there’s a lesson there He wants you to learn. But trust Him to give you the strength to overcome the hardship."
3562,2018-04-24 10:35:12+00:00,muftimenk,"When the Almighty strategically places blessings in your path, acknowledge them and thank Him for what He has bestowed on you. They’re placed there for a reason. He’s watching how you use them to gain His Pleasure. Don’t lose the plot."
3563,2018-04-23 17:58:11+00:00,muftimenk,Why would you waste your time and energy worrying about something that hasn’t even happened? Worry is a natural emotion. It’s up to you to control it and stop it in its tracks before it spirals out of control. Get your focus back. Don’t let Satan mess with your mind.
3564,2018-04-23 12:17:09+00:00,muftimenk,"You think you have it tougher than others. Stand your ground.Hold on to your faith, your integrity. Don’t let anyone sidetrack you. The Almighty never promised you an easy journey. Tough times will reveal your true character. Seek His help. Be strong. Don’t quit."
3565,2018-04-23 05:39:00+00:00,muftimenk,"For a calm and more peaceful life, quit listening to gossip and learn to ignore what others are saying about you. Look for the good in everything. Learn to be positive and spread goodness. Always remember to be grateful for your life. And let the Almighty handle everything else!"
3566,2018-04-22 16:00:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful who you seek advice from because not everyone who acts friendly is a friend. There are people out there who can mislead you, cause mischief and those who may not have the right intention. Ask the Almighty to place someone in your path whom you can trust."
3567,2018-04-22 07:37:21+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has worked it out for you. He has a specific purpose for your life and yours alone. You need to trust Him fully. Not half-heartedly. You will be tested and tried but if you bear patience, the end result will only bring you happiness."
3568,2018-04-21 23:03:12+00:00,muftimenk,Don't have sleepless nights over your enemies. The Almighty will take care of them and  give them their due for causing all the hurt and trouble. Have faith things will work out fine and that you’ll emerge better than you were before.
3569,2018-04-21 10:52:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Pray even when you don’t feel like praying. Prayer changes things. What do you want to change? Difficult people, bad situations, low morale, weak faith. Open your heart and pray. Pray sincerely. The Almighty is ever ready to listen and answer your prayers."
3570,2018-04-21 04:20:46+00:00,muftimenk,"We tend to complain too much. Our job is too difficult. Our parents are too demanding. Our children are too mischievous. Chronic complaining never makes anything better, it saps your energy &amp; the energy of those around you. Look for the positives. You’ll be a much happier person."
3571,2018-04-20 15:03:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Some people make your life so difficult. It’s as if they find joy in doing such things. When you feel you’ve done your best to get along with them but can’t, don’t fret. The Almighty won’t allow such people to break you. Trust Him and He will find a way out for you!"
3572,2018-04-19 23:17:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, help us truly understand that things work by Your schedule. Not ours. We tend to forget that. We’re always in a rush. That’s what this world has taught us. Sadly, we forget that one of the biggest life lessons You’re teaching us is patience!"

You have to believe and trust that He wants the best for you. He’s your Creator.  Whatever’s happening, He knows without a doubt!"
3576,2018-04-18 10:17:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Life's challenges come in all shapes &amp; sizes. Your journey is yours alone. It’s unique to you. Don’t expect anything from anyone. If you want something done well, do it yourself. Trust the Almighty who’s keeping watch over you. Wherever life takes you, it’s part of His Plan."
3577,2018-04-17 23:23:03+00:00,muftimenk,"We've all had our fair share of “nos” and closed doors.  Don’t be discouraged.  It’s all temporary. Just like this life is temporary. When the time is right, the Almighty will open your doors which will lead you to all the “yeses”. Be patient. Have faith."
3578,2018-04-17 14:57:18+00:00,muftimenk,You can’t choose your family. The Almighty has done that for you. So learn to give and take and accept them for who they are. Flaws and all. It’s not easy. But know that breaking the ties of kinship is a huge sin. Remain respectful and keep the peace.
3579,2018-04-17 04:50:22+00:00,muftimenk,Does your heart feel burdened? Do you feel like your life is crumbling? Bad days happen to everyone. Start counting your blessings.

3581,2018-04-16 14:33:57+00:00,muftimenk,Losing someone you love is a huge test of faith. That’s the reality of this life. How you pick yourself up and carry on shows how much you understand the Almighty’s plan. May He help us cope with our loss and reunite us with our loved ones in Paradise.
3582,2018-04-16 06:27:55+00:00,muftimenk,Don't take your sins lightly. You may think you’ve done nothing wrong but you forgot that one person you shouted at when you lost your temper;  the other person you pushed aside so you got ahead in the queue. May the Almighty help us to constantly reflect on our shortcomings.
3583,2018-04-15 22:12:47+00:00,muftimenk,"When you supplicate to the Almighty, never think for a moment that He might get tired listening to you or angry or even fed up because you keep asking and asking. Remember, He’s our Creator. Nothing is impossible for Him. So keep asking!"
3584,2018-04-15 08:50:28+00:00,muftimenk,"In life, there’s so much we can’t control. That’s the main reason why we are anxious. So instead of worrying, learn to focus on the things that we can control and then put our trust in the Almighty to take care of all the rest. You will feel the weight lifted from your shoulders!"
3585,2018-04-14 20:55:35+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how sad or how low you feel, don’t opt for a temporary high by going against what the Almighty has prescribed. It won’t last and you’ll end up feeling worse. It will rob you of your peace and gain His Wrath."
3586,2018-04-14 14:15:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be foolish and expose every blessing of your life to everyone and think that they’ll be happy for you. Some will, but many won’t. The evil eye is real. Learn to keep things private and not to share too much with those who could possibly harm you."
3587,2018-04-14 04:16:01+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re hurting, the Almighty will heal you. If you’re lost, only He can guide you. If you see darkness in your life, only He can be that beacon of light.

It doesn’t happen overnight. You need a conscious effort and lots of help from the Almighty. Keep working on it. Nothing happens without His Will."
3589,2018-04-13 16:19:37+00:00,muftimenk,That's the test... https://t.co/FlQbG4hIw3
3590,2018-04-13 04:49:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, grant ease to everyone going through trials. May they face this new day with hope in their hearts. May You lighten the heavy burden each one is shouldering right now. Help them to remember that this too shall pass &amp; that nothing lasts!"
3591,2018-04-12 12:07:10+00:00,muftimenk,The sad truth today is many lose  themselves in the crowd trying to fit in. Learn to hold your ground. Remain steadfast in your beliefs. It’s not easy. People will mock you &amp; taunt you. They’ll make you feel uncomfortable. Get hold of yourself. The Almighty will lift you.
3592,2018-04-11 23:15:28+00:00,muftimenk,"When everything seems to be against you and you start thinking that you’re a loser, think again.  Is there any limit to the Almighty’s power? Did He not bring you this far? Do you think He will abandon you? When you believe and trust Him, all things are possible."
3593,2018-04-11 12:31:44+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want change, do something about it. Change requires action. People will talk about wanting change and yet do nothing that requires them to change. If you’re sincere about it, seek the Almighty’s help. He will pave the way for you."
3594,2018-04-10 23:50:38+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty tests us with success. Many find it so easy to forget Him when success comes their way. But if you remember that your success comes from Him, you will pass the test with flying colours!"
3595,2018-04-10 16:29:11+00:00,muftimenk,"We live in a selfish world today. Every man for himself. But don’t be selfish with your prayer, Pray for your friends, your family, loved ones, as well as those you don't know. Remember, you may think it’s not much but your sincere prayer can change someone's situation!"
3596,2018-04-10 05:47:38+00:00,muftimenk,"If you don’t want to be let down, don’t wait for someone else’s praise. The truth is you don’t need it. You have the resounding support from the Lord of the Worlds. Work for His acceptance rather than other people’s applause."
3597,2018-04-09 18:21:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Some won’t understand you. Some won’t support you. Some will leave you. Some won’t care if you’re down in the dumps. But no matter what others put you through, your Creator will always be there for you. He knows every moment of your struggle. He will compensate you greatly!"

3599,2018-04-09 09:37:33+00:00,muftimenk,"For as long you’re alive, keep hope alive. Hope in the Mercy of the Almighty. Hope that He wants what’s best for you &amp; will give it to you at the right time. So whatever you’re facing - trials, stress, broken affairs, have hope that they’re all temporary. Better days are ahead."
3600,2018-04-08 19:31:27+00:00,muftimenk,"The world will demand so much from you. But at the end of the day, never forget that you’re human. Just like everyone else. You’ll feel pain, you’ll get hurt, youll feel broken, you’ll break down. That’s part of the process called life. You’ll be okay in the end."
3601,2018-04-08 11:38:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Your wealth, your children, your beauty, your power should never make you feel arrogant. Remember, like a bolt from the blue, the Almighty can reclaim whatever belongs to Him. Anytime. But if you want something that lasts, choose humility and kindness."
3602,2018-04-08 04:06:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't forget to thank the Almighty for the problems He kept away from us.  We tend to forget that not all have roofs over their heads or three meals, clean water, a safe environment. There are those who live daily, in fear of being tortured, oppressed and killed. Pray for them."
3603,2018-04-07 18:47:38+00:00,muftimenk,"We spend so much and invest even more in order to project the best image of ourselves to the world. Yet, on the inside, many are crumbling and falling apart. Isn’t it time to invest wisely and pay heed to what lies beneath?"
3604,2018-04-07 10:49:31+00:00,muftimenk,"The All-Knowing is fully aware what others do behind your back. He knows every person who has done you wrong, every injustice, every plot against you. Relax because you can’t control such events. The Almighty will rule in your favour. You only have to trust Him."
3605,2018-04-07 00:45:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Some days are better than others. That’s how life is. Learn to look for the blessing in each day. There’s no need to curse at how things are going. Be strong, stay positive. You can’t do it all because you’re human but you can try your best."
3606,2018-04-06 12:32:56+00:00,muftimenk,"When you let envy breed in your heart, it will surely affect your faith, providing a way in for Satan.  This will lead to ungratefulness, hatred, backbiting and discontent. It causes division within the community, and even worse, within the family. Take heed!"
3607,2018-04-05 23:33:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Why do we feel disconnected from the Almighty at times? Especially when we’re being tested and when seemingly “bad things” are happening to us. We tend to forget that in reality, we have direct access to Him at all times. He’s our lifeline. Never overlook that fact!"
3608,2018-04-05 12:18:53+00:00,muftimenk,"Wherever you came from, whatever you’ve done; all these don’t matter. They don’t have to limit where you’re headed. Remember at the end of the day, how you started is not the issue. What matters most is how you end. Finish strong!"
3609,2018-04-05 05:59:14+00:00,muftimenk,"Everything the Almighty puts us through is to allow us to grow and to elevate our status. Nothing in this life happens by chance. Once you open your heart to your Creator, you’ll see Him in every part of your life. So read the signs and you’ll find contentment."
3610,2018-04-04 21:59:53+00:00,muftimenk,"We need to change our mindsets when we ask the Almighty for something. Why do we ask and yet think we probably won’t get it? Why are we so pessimistic? Ask Him with sincerity, optimism and full of faith. Do this and watch how things will change."
3611,2018-04-04 14:29:03+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re able to accept everything that happens to you as part of the Almighty’s plan, you’re on the road to something greater. Remember, one day, all the pieces of the puzzle will fit and you’ll be so pleased that you were patient right till the end!"
3612,2018-04-03 21:01:36+00:00,muftimenk,"No one knows what the future  holds but what we do know is the Almighty has a plan for us. So no matter how bad the past  has been, how many times we fell and picked ourselves up, all that matters is we’re trying to get close to Him. None of this will be wasted!"
3613,2018-04-03 14:29:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is tough. When you look around the world today, it’s easy to lose hope. But you mustn’t. Because the Lord of the Worlds is in full control. Count your blessings, make the most of life. Even if it means getting through day by day, never forgetting your link with your Maker."
3614,2018-04-03 04:47:51+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will always find a way for us if it’s meant for us. It doesn't matter how many obstacles we face, the mountains we have to climb or the rivers we have to cross. At the end of it all, we will be fine because He is our guiding light."
3615,2018-04-02 20:01:42+00:00,muftimenk,There will be days when you feel confused. You feel like there’s both light and darkness inside you. What matters most is the part that you choose to act on. Strive towards light and goodness always. Resist the temptation to do the opposite!
3616,2018-04-02 08:56:49+00:00,muftimenk,"When you don’t understand the Almighty’s plan, you’re more likely to lose hope. You feel like you’re doing everything wrong &amp; you’re unsure about what lies ahead. But don’t give up. Keep talking to Him. He’s All-Knowing. He will steer you in the right direction."
3617,2018-04-01 23:01:53+00:00,muftimenk,You're having it tough. You can’t seem to move forward because you’re always looking in the rear view mirror. Don’t keep going back to where you’ve been. Move ahead. Focus on where you’re going. It’s time to look at blessings the Almighty has placed in your path. Start today!
3618,2018-04-01 15:13:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan is a genius mastermind. His goal is to make us lose our sense of shame, forget our link with our Creator, do as we please and ignore all respectable boundaries. His role is to lead us slowly but surely towards the forbidden tree. Don’t fall for it. Stay vigilant!"
3619,2018-04-01 08:28:40+00:00,muftimenk,There is always someone out there who has it worse than you. Don’t forget that. The Almighty has blessed you with more than you could ever ask for. You didn’t even have to ask for it. Gratitude is the key. Be grateful and He will grant you more.
3620,2018-03-31 23:05:32+00:00,muftimenk,We all have faults. We’ve all been through failures. We all have our frustrations. But never let them consume you. The Almighty knows what you’re going through. He knows your fears. Hand over all these and more to Him. Lighten your load!
3621,2018-03-31 15:31:48+00:00,muftimenk,Why are we often worried about what people can or can’t do for us.? Stop depending on others if you don’t want disappointments. Seek the Almighty. He loves it when you ask Him. He’s the Owner of everything. He’s Lord of the Worlds. You only have to ask.
3622,2018-03-31 07:41:30+00:00,muftimenk,"You can reboot your life many times over and start afresh but if the program doesn’t involve the Almighty, you’ll be back to square one in no time. Never leave Him out of your equation if you want success in this world and the next!"
3623,2018-03-30 14:54:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to look at your own faults often. In fact, when you scrutinise yourself, you wouldn’t dare to look for faults in others. Even if you spent every minute of your waking hours seeking  His forgiveness, it wouldn’t be enough. But have hope because the Almighty is Merciful."
3624,2018-03-30 07:47:25+00:00,muftimenk,We’re too quick to judge and that’s a fact. We label the quiet ones as snobbish. Has it occurred to us that they could be hiding a deep pain &amp; prefer not to talk about it? Be gentle with people just like we’d like them to be gentle with us. Don’t assume anything.
3625,2018-03-29 22:16:02+00:00,muftimenk,It's easy to get caught up in this life to the point where you forget your spirituality and why you’re here. Make it a habit to start your day and end your day remembering the Almighty. Everything else in between will fall into place. Try it
3626,2018-03-29 12:59:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The closer you get to the Almighty, the more clearly you see yourself. You’re more critical of your weakness and your sins. You repent more. You seek His forgiveness more. You spend more time thinking about your link with Him and how to strengthen the bond."
3627,2018-03-29 02:24:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Patience is not easy. It’s  not for the fainthearted. That’s why the rewards are so great. It can break you, wreck you, makes you want to scream and give up but you press on because you know that’s what the Almighty loves. He is always with the patient."
3628,2018-03-28 16:58:29+00:00,muftimenk,Many people get upset when their work is not acknowledged. Don’t be. The Almighty knows what you’ve done and how much effort and sacrifice went into it. Isn’t that the best acknowledgment one could ever wish for?
3629,2018-03-28 04:16:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you at times, feel that your life is one big obstacle course?  It seems as soon as you cross over one obstacle, another one awaits you. Don’t give up. The Almighty has your back, no matter what you’re going through!"
3630,2018-03-27 18:47:51+00:00,muftimenk,One of the biggest gifts you can give someone today is your time and attention. Learn to cut back on time spent on the phone and social media. Facebook. Twitter. Snapchat. Instagram. They can all wait. Focus your attention on your family and rekindle meaningful relationships!
3631,2018-03-27 04:08:32+00:00,muftimenk,"One of the toughest tests is to be kind to those who’ve not been kind to you. Revenge is a waste of time. You get a temporary high. Then it’s over. So forgive, do good, show mercy, lift the one who pushed you down. Can you imagine what the Almighty will have in store for you?"
3632,2018-03-26 20:56:21+00:00,muftimenk,Some people enjoy slandering others and ruining their chances of marriage. They do this out of jealousy and envy. You can't stop them. Let people judge you by your character.  Be upright. Be strong. Surely the Almighty is aware of the evil they’re spreading.
3633,2018-03-26 11:25:10+00:00,muftimenk,"No one is doomed for as long as you feel remorse after you’ve sinned. As long as you’re seeking forgiveness, the Almighty will forgive you. Satan will tease and taunt you that you’re not worthy of being forgiven. Ignore such thoughts. Never doubt His Mercy."
3634,2018-03-25 22:35:07+00:00,muftimenk,What ever it is that you want may be taking a lot longer than you had expected. But that’s okay. Don’t fret and don’t give up. The Almighty has a way of doing things and it’s not our way. Trust His timing.
3635,2018-03-25 10:46:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Just because you fall or commit a sin, doesn’t mean you’re evil. It shows you’re human. But how you fix yourself thereafter is what matters most. Get back up and turn to the Almighty as soon as you can. With each fall, repent and never give up."
3636,2018-03-25 04:20:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't stress too much over those who try to cheat or hurt you. Remember, whatever goes around comes around. No evil doer will get away scot-free and any good will always be rewarded. Have faith in Almighty and get on with your life."
3637,2018-03-24 21:56:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't give up just because you’re facing a temporary setback. The Almighty never promised a smooth journey. He never promised a life free of tests. But He promised that with hardship, there’ll be ease &amp; nothing in this life lasts forever. So bear patience for a little while more."
3638,2018-03-24 14:47:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Staying on the path is never easy. There’ll be brickbats, there’ll be distractions. There are many spiteful people around just waiting to throw you off course. Don’t allow that to happen. Tell the Almighty your anxiety. Ask Him to protect you."
3639,2018-03-24 04:39:14+00:00,muftimenk,"No act of kindness that you do, no matter how small will go unnoticed. The Almighty is All-Knowing and sees what you do in private and He has promised to reward you openly for your faithfulness."
3640,2018-03-23 17:42:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be distracted and start comparing yourself to others. Comparison is a distraction. It sidetracks you from your original course. Instead of comparing yourself to others, recognize that the Almighty has bestowed on each of us just what we need for our individual journey!"
3641,2018-03-23 09:39:51+00:00,muftimenk,"You can't win a race if you keep looking back at the starting line, you have to look at the finish line. Don't worry about the failures &amp; what you did in the past. Look to the future with great hope. Remember, the Almighty always wants the best for us."
3642,2018-03-23 03:46:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we thank You for giving us the strength when we felt like giving up. We’ve learnt not to panic  because we know You’re with us. Keep our hearts firm in faith, come what may. We trust in the plans You have for us... for a bright future. Aameen."
3643,2018-03-22 20:50:41+00:00,muftimenk,"The minute Satan sees you getting closer to the Almighty, he will distract you. He will do his utmost to block your spiritual growth. He will eat into your discipline and consistency. Understand his evil plan. Stay firm in faith and seek help from the Almighty."
3644,2018-03-22 15:16:45+00:00,muftimenk,You want inner peace? Don’t worry about what  others may think of you or whatever people may say. Lower your expectation of others. Don’t be distracted by the petty talk people may throw at you. Focus on what you want to achieve and keep going.
3645,2018-03-22 03:11:16+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what’s going on, always uphold decent character and conduct. Let them criticise, let them pick on petty issues, let them say nasty things. Be good and kind-hearted even if they aren’t. Do they think they’ll get away with it? Remember there’s Judgement Day!"
3646,2018-03-21 20:08:04+00:00,muftimenk,Don't give up. Don’t quit. Hang in there. The Almighty loves you. He knows you’re trying hard. He knows the sacrifices you’re making. Don’t be afraid of what’s to come. He wants you to have firm faith in Him. Difficult journeys lead to beautiful destinations ultimately!
3647,2018-03-21 08:35:53+00:00,muftimenk,Are you the person who still manages to smile amidst chaos in your daily life? When your heart is full of pain and your eyes brimmed with tears but you soldier on because you know how much the Almighty loves patience; you know that the reward is beyond anything you can imagine!
3648,2018-03-20 22:33:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't complain about who wronged you and who treated you unfairly. It’s all part of the Almighty’s plan to teach you life lessons; that’s why He allowed it. Once you’ve learnt them, you’ll be ready for new opportunities. He will open new doors for you."
3649,2018-03-20 16:31:16+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve achieved something good, be prepared for the haters to come out in full force. They might ridicule you, spread rumours about you or even spew harsh words. Don’t worry. Focus on what’s right &amp; keep going. The Almighty is on your side."

3651,2018-03-19 15:21:21+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't let your grief consume you to such an extent that you forget who’s in control. Try to step away from your broken state, even if just for a moment. You’ll see things clearer and realise that you own nothing. Nothing at all. Everything is on loan from the Almighty."
3652,2018-03-19 06:02:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Nobody gets everything they want in this world. The nature of this world is such that things won’t go according to your plans. It’s all up to the Almighty. So when your faith is being put to the test, don’t crumble. Supplicate to Him. That’s the only way to change things."
3653,2018-03-18 20:59:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember that everyone is being tested. You’re not the only one. Be patient with others because they’re also facing their own trials. Try to be considerate when dealing with people. Whatever you’re experiencing, the Almighty will surely resolve it in His own time."
3654,2018-03-18 11:08:07+00:00,muftimenk,"You're stronger than you think. Every battle you’ve fought, every scar and wound, every stumble and fall - they’ve all made you into who you are today. So take on everything that comes your way calmly, with quiet confidence. The Almighty won’t give you more than you can bear."
3655,2018-03-18 00:18:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Sad things will happen in your life. Try not to be upset, learn to accept things and take it in your stride. It’s all part of the Almighty’s plan. So choose to be accepting and face everything with full confidence, knowing that He’s watching over you. Always."
3656,2018-03-17 12:01:08+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone hurts you, don’t keep the resentment in your heart. Forgive them. Don’t let the resentment control you. It can make you miserable &amp; stuck in your past. You'll end up being controlled by the past. Let it all go. Move on."
3657,2018-03-17 03:28:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you ever feel like you’ve wasted time with some people who never appreciated what you did for them? Don’t worry. You may have given more than you should but with the Almighty, nothing is ever wasted. He will reward you for all that you’ve done."
3658,2018-03-16 15:51:56+00:00,muftimenk,"We want to get close to the Almighty. But we’re hardly aware with what we’re doing. Sadly, awareness isn’t always present in a rush-rush life. We move so fast. We can’t or don’t stop to think about what we’re doing or why we’re doing it. Slow down. Make Him a part of your life."
3659,2018-03-16 06:39:20+00:00,muftimenk,Never forget how far you’ve come. It’s easy to get carried away when times are good. There was a day when you didn't know how you could possibly go on. But you did. Always give thanks to the One who made it all possible. Stay humble.
3660,2018-03-15 23:53:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we ask You to restore the broken parts of us and change them into something great. Guide us in all ways and let us not be complacent with all that You have bestowed on us. Make us humble, knowing that You can change anything.. anytime."

Things appear unfair and nothing is going according to your plan. Well, keep your heart firm in faith, knowing that the Almighty will indeed reveal His plans soon."
3664,2018-03-14 18:36:41+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re angry, try not to say anything. Remain silent. It’s very difficult and requires discipline. This will stop you from uttering mean words out of anger. Your anger will pass. But your mean words can scar someone for life. So use kind words or be silent."
3665,2018-03-14 06:32:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Wasting time is worse than wasting money. Some will have more money than others. But we all have twenty four hours in a day. No one can buy more time on earth. Remember, a wasted dollar comes back, it can be earned. But a wasted minute is gone for good. Use your time wisely."

3671,2018-03-11 18:16:21+00:00,muftimenk,"This world is such that there’ll be people who love you and people who hate you. Remember, you’re not for everyone and that’s ok. So don’t waste your time with those who won’t give you time of day. Share your journey with those who value you."
3672,2018-03-11 08:11:42+00:00,muftimenk,"You may be among the most beautiful, but if your tongue is ugly, your beauty will never be enhanced.  Protect yourself against arrogant speech and looking down on others. The Almighty has blessed us all differently."

You only have to turn to Him. He’s capable of giving you what you want and more. He will heal you. He will protect you."
3674,2018-03-10 16:01:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. May we seek solutions and a way out from You instead of turning to others in times of hardship, pain and loss. Let us not search for temporary comforts in people and worldly things. Make us among those who seek help through patience and prayer."
3675,2018-03-10 09:00:02+00:00,muftimenk,"Treat people with respect and always be kind. When we do that, we give them the space to grow and change. Don’t give up on others, especially family members and loved ones. Remember, the Almighty didn’t give up on you!"

3710,2018-02-23 10:36:33+00:00,muftimenk,"There's no need to be discouraged by trouble and difficulty. Remember, it will not defeat you unless you allow it to. In fact, hardship and trials toughen you and prepare you for life’s challenges."
3711,2018-02-23 04:35:31+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, give us the strength and courage to stay firm and hold on to our belief. Don’t make us among those who lose ourselves in a crowd just because we want to fit in. Make us worry less about what people think of us. Only You matter in the end!"
3712,2018-02-22 22:01:38+00:00,muftimenk,"Each time you’re tempted to give up, think of how far you’ve come. Everything you’ve been through; the times you thought you couldn’t make it but did; the mornings you couldn’t get out of bed but pushed yourself anyway. Always seek your strength from the Almighty. You’ll be ok!"
3713,2018-02-22 16:42:46+00:00,muftimenk,Where you are today isn’t where you will stay. Nothing lasts. The Almighty has promised us. Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise with each new day. Keep hope alive in your heart. He's right with you!
3714,2018-02-22 05:11:37+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty knows you’re trying. He will keep testing you to see if you’re sincere; if you’re striving your utmost and bearing patience. Honestly, that’s all that matters. That He knows you tried your best!"
3715,2018-02-21 21:53:42+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty doesn’t waste anything. Everything we go through is part of our life’s journey. The tests, the trials, the difficulties, the delays, the unfair situations; they all serve their purpose eventually. Trust in His Plans."
3716,2018-02-21 13:04:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't belittle the gifts the Almighty has bestowed on you by comparing your life to others. Looking at other people’s accounts on social media, their wealth, their holidays, their lifestyle can create discontentment, even envy in you. Don’t go that route. Be grateful!"
3717,2018-02-21 04:15:55+00:00,muftimenk,May the Almighty grant ease to the children of #Ghouta. Alleviate their suffering and keep them safe from the massacre going on in the area. Aameen. #SaveGhouta
3718,2018-02-20 14:34:19+00:00,muftimenk,Never think that all the prayers you’ve been making are wasted. Nothing ever goes to waste with the Almighty. He’s got everything under control. The dreams you’ve been wanting so badly will come when He decides you’re ready for it!
3719,2018-02-20 04:32:05+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’ve wronged someone, don’t try to turn the tables and make yourself the wronged party. You may think you’re getting away with it but the Almighty knows. In fact, you should be afraid because when it all comes back  to you, the truth will out. He knows best!"
3720,2018-02-19 17:37:52+00:00,muftimenk,It's common to blame others when things are not going your way. Looking for a scapegoat is easy. Blaming keeps people from having to look at what they did to get into the mess. But it takes a real man to admit fault and show remorse. Only then are you able to grow!
3721,2018-02-19 14:58:33+00:00,muftimenk,"Look at what young #Menk has been up to. He definitely deserves a retweet, like or share! I watched it unfolding. #NYC made in #Zimbabwe. Proud of you! https://t.co/VGstguTTry"
3722,2018-02-19 04:51:46+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is each night we go to bed not knowing whether we’ll be alive the next day. Yet, we carry on making plans and doing things as we normally do. It’s the hope in our hearts that keeps us going! Always thank the Almighty for another day to right the wrongs of yesterday."
3723,2018-02-18 17:06:09+00:00,muftimenk,It's common for us to become frustrated with a given trial or  situation and we complain and vent about it to everyone. But take a step back and think. The truth is we never know what goodness the Almighty has in store for us from the trial.
3724,2018-02-18 09:34:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't take for granted the favours of our Creator. No matter how much water there is around you, be mindful of those who are facing severe shortage of this precious resource from the Almighty.  Don’t waste water. #SaveWater #EveryDropCounts"
3725,2018-02-18 05:00:18+00:00,muftimenk,Imagine if the Almighty bestowed your blessings all at once! It would be a waste. You wouldn’t be able to enjoy it to the fullest. There’s wisdom in waiting; in bearing patience. So keep your faith and wait for the right time.
3726,2018-02-17 21:12:26+00:00,muftimenk,"At some stage in your life, you’ve felt that life’s unfair. When you feel that way, you have to remind yourself that the Almighty is always in control, no matter what’s going on. Refuse to worry.  Thank Him, knowing that He will always fight your battles."
3727,2018-02-17 09:09:54+00:00,muftimenk,"While my Twitter following has crossed the 3 million mark, I must acknowledge that those of you who retweet, like or comment have played big role in maximising the benefit and achieving this level. May the Almighty reward one and all. Aameen"
3728,2018-02-17 04:13:40+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty will never stop loving you, will never give up on you, will always have your back, will keep reminding you to turn back to Him, will pick you up each time you fall. So when the Most Merciful is there for you, who can be against you?"
3729,2018-02-16 15:16:03+00:00,muftimenk,"All shades of colours are beautiful. Remember, the Almighty doesn’t tolerate arrogance and racism. It’s a sin. He is only concerned with the state of your heart and your level of piety. Keep your focus on the right things."
3730,2018-02-16 05:12:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, we pray for those who are suffering &amp; broken. Those who are trying to shake off their past mistakes &amp; have a better life. Those who cry alone at night while the world sleeps. Grant them peace and healing. Aameen."
3731,2018-02-15 20:15:52+00:00,muftimenk,Do remember that not everything about you is meant to be disclosed to everyone. Keep private things private. Be discerning. It will keep you from a ton of trouble and disappointment in the end.
3732,2018-02-15 07:39:13+00:00,muftimenk,My recent visit to the @IslamicMuseum in Melbourne Australia was enlightening. https://t.co/xBJvYutaLo
3733,2018-02-15 02:59:38+00:00,muftimenk,One of the biggest flaws in humans is pretending to be blind to their own shortcomings but they’re the first to jump down someone's throat when others make a mistake. Learn to be more self critical instead of always pointing fingers.
3734,2018-02-14 21:09:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you have a true friend? Someone who doesn’t care about your status or wealth; what car you drive, the kind of house you live in; who you socialise with, the one who will always defend you in your absence. If you do, you’re blessed. Hang on tight to that friend!"
3735,2018-02-14 15:01:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Backbiting often results from a weakness in the backbiter’s own soul, such as an inferiority complex. You should pry into your soul to discover what weakness prompted you to backbite another person. Only then can you set out to remedy that weakness!"
3736,2018-02-14 05:21:13+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t waste your valuable time with people who have nothing but negativity in them. They criticise everything and everyone in the most damaging of ways. Choose to stay away from such toxic people at all costs. Do it for your well-being.
3737,2018-02-13 20:19:56+00:00,muftimenk,Life is never smooth sailing. We all get knocked down at some stage. The biggest test is how quickly we get back up. We must never stay down for long. Seek the Almighty’s help and you’ll stand up again and start moving forward.
3738,2018-02-13 14:32:54+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is most people are afraid of being judged, of being not good enough, of not being liked. So they protect themselves by acting tough or being sarcastic, or making jokes or just being fake. Work hard to be your honest self and you’ll attract the right people."
3739,2018-02-13 03:00:52+00:00,muftimenk,"You're depressed and everything may look bleak now. You’re wondering if things will ever get better. Yes they will. The Almighty has promised us that after hardship, there’ll be ease. Don’t despair. There is hope yet!"
3740,2018-02-12 15:16:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Think of death often. The Angel of Death can visit us at any moment. Remember, death doesn’t discriminate between the young or old. Seek the Almighty’s forgiveness. May He make us among the people of Paradise."
3741,2018-02-12 07:55:10+00:00,muftimenk,Don't keep replaying the bad that’s happened over and over again in your mind. Don’t over think. Let it all go. We’re humans and we’re prone to making mistakes. Repent. Seek sincere forgiveness and move on. That’s what the Almighty wants from us.
3742,2018-02-11 22:04:46+00:00,muftimenk,It's human nature to take things for granted. Don’t put things off till tomorrow. Be disciplined enough to do it today. Things might be different tomorrow. The ones you love may no longer be there. Nothing is guaranteed. That’s a reality. What if tomorrow never comes?
3743,2018-02-11 07:44:57+00:00,muftimenk,The past is over and done with. You can’t rewrite it but you can certainly reset your future. Make a conscious effort to let go of yesterday and move forward with quiet confidence to the goodness that the Almighty has planned.
3744,2018-02-10 21:47:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t be fooled by Satan. He will make you think something is a failure and nothing good will come out of it.  Remember, the Lord of the Worlds has a way of making miracles out of mistakes. He will make you emerge from it even stronger than before."
3745,2018-02-10 15:47:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Our journey is paved with sadness &amp; periods of happiness as well. No matter what the Almighty places in our path, keep putting one foot in front of the other, even when it hurts. Remember, no one knows what lies ahead but the One who made us. It will always be what’s good for us."
3746,2018-02-10 06:55:19+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as you must remember to thank the Almighty for everything He’s bestowed on you, don’t forget to thank Him for what didn’t happen as well. Thank Him for the doors He has closed and the problems He has stopped that you knew nothing about."
3747,2018-02-09 22:05:16+00:00,muftimenk,"Thank the Almighty, no matter what the circumstances. It’s not just to do with wealth &amp; good things. Thank Him for guiding you &amp; keeping you steadfast. Thank Him for increase in knowledge, for the lessons you’ve learnt form hardship. Do this each day and He will give you more."
3748,2018-02-09 12:39:52+00:00,muftimenk,"Know that you will never understand everything that’s going on in your life. Why things happen the way they do. If you try to figure it all out, you’ll end up getting frustrated. Leave it to the All-Knowing Almighty. Trust Him!"
3749,2018-02-09 02:56:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this day, help us to often think of the day when we’ll be returning to You. Take us only when You are totally pleased with us. Make us understand that each day of this life gives us a chance to further prepare whatever we need for that long-awaited meeting with You."
3750,2018-02-08 13:31:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Today, it has become difficult to distinguish truth from falsehood. Society has become so fake that the truth actually bothers some people. Be cautious of what you hear and spread to others. Check and double check your news and their sources before you hit that send button!"
3751,2018-02-07 19:27:53+00:00,muftimenk,"The scars you get in life are proof of your inner strength. It shows you've lived your life fully; how you picked yourself up when you fell, how you handled defeat, darkness and storms. These are among the Almighty’s biggest tests and what truly matters in the end!"
3752,2018-02-07 05:12:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be fooled by the glitz and glamour you see around you. Everyone has problems. Every single one, without exception. It’s just that some prefer to talk about it, while others choose to hide it; away from the prying eyes of the public."
3753,2018-02-06 21:52:15+00:00,muftimenk,"Take time to examine the state of your heart often. If the Angel of Death came today, would you be prepared? Are you happy with your life thus far? Are you happy with the way you’ve spent your time? Are you happy with what you’ll be presenting to the One who made you?"
3754,2018-02-06 16:03:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When things get too complicated and you don’t understand what’s going on in your life right now, keep a heart full of trust and keep moving forward. Don’t listen to the naysayers. In time, things will get clearer"
3755,2018-02-06 05:05:51+00:00,muftimenk,"If you think it’s one hardship after another and you feel like  caving in, think again. The Almighty knows you can handle it. He knows you’re strong. He wants you to remember that difficult battles are ONLY given to strong soldiers!"
3756,2018-02-05 21:55:39+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is the online space is getting ftom bad to worse. People think and type away behind walls of fake names and identity; they think they can get away with it because nobody knows. The truth is the Almighty knows. Remember, you’ll be held accountable for all your actions."
3757,2018-02-05 15:07:47+00:00,muftimenk,"Strive to develop a relationship with the One we’re praying to. The trouble with most of us, we just want our prayers answered and don’t give much thought to the One we’re asking from. We love His gift but we ignore the Giver. Learn to be grateful and He will give you more!"
3758,2018-02-05 05:22:27+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever doesn’t feel right, don’t do it. Remove it from your life. Don’t listen to the whispering of Satan. He wants you to feel despair. The Almighty doesn’t. He only wants what’s best for you. Always seek His help sincerely. He will guide you."
3759,2018-02-04 20:08:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Treasure the gift of time. Once it’s gone, you won’t see it again.  And there’ll come a day when your time in this world will be over. Don’t regret your life while letting the minutes slip by.  Live the best way you can in the Almighty’s  obedience!"
3760,2018-02-04 15:04:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Everyone, including good people will do bad things. That’s the nature of humans. We all have flaws. We all commit sins. Nobody is perfect. But learn from your mistakes and try to become a better person with each passing day. It’s never too late to change."
3761,2018-02-04 10:01:20+00:00,muftimenk,"Occasionally, someone opens up to you like never before; showing you their heart &amp; all that comes with it. The hurt, the wounds &amp; scars. Honour the fact that they confided in you. It takes a huge amount of courage &amp; trust to do that! Don’t betray them!"
3762,2018-02-04 03:47:40+00:00,muftimenk,"When you reach the level of trust in the Almighty, without any reservation, you don’t stress over life. You let Him do what He wills. If He opens a  door for you, thank Him; if it doesn’t open, you still thank Him. That’s the beauty of complete trust!"
3763,2018-02-03 21:16:57+00:00,muftimenk,"In this day and age, many young people hang on to the belief that  if it feels good, do it. This simply means you’re allowing yourself to be controlled by your moods, living life according to your feelings. This can be dangerous.  Learn to live a life of faith!"
3764,2018-02-03 15:15:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary not to oppress anyone. The Almighty is All-Knowing and He will ensure one way or another that the one who oppresses will be the one who comes back (even years) later, needing something from the one he oppressed. That’s life!"
3765,2018-02-03 04:58:59+00:00,muftimenk,"We tend to worry because we wonder if we will have what we need, when we need it. But remember that if we expect other people to meet our needs instead of the Almighty, we will end up frustrated and disappointed.  He is the only One who can meet all our needs!"
3766,2018-02-02 20:42:47+00:00,muftimenk,"When you put the Almighty at the top of your priority list, watch the doors He'll open for you. He knows what’s in your heart so do it sincerely. Don’t pay lip service with your Creator. Do your best, leave the rest to Him and watch your life unfold."
3767,2018-02-02 10:25:01+00:00,muftimenk,"When you feel you’ve hit rock bottom and can’t take it anymore, understand that the Almighty wants you to know that everyone may have abandoned you, but the One who made you will always be there for you. Seek Him."
3768,2018-02-02 04:57:12+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how long the delays, how many closed doors you’ve experienced, keep things in perspective. Embrace the lessons. They’re all good in the end. The Almighty allowed them into your life. Be grateful."
3769,2018-02-01 20:45:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, protect us from being leaking buckets; those who follow up their good deeds with bad ones. May we not be among those who pray daily but curse &amp; swear others, or those who derive pleasure when others fail. Keep us mindful of such behaviour."
3770,2018-02-01 11:36:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't think you’ve made it in life because of your power, position and authority. None of it will last. Nothing in this life will last. So always remain humble and attach your heart to that which matters. Keep the Almighty close and you’ll emerge the winner!"
3771,2018-02-01 03:51:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Hijab is a right today, tomorrow and everyday. The right to cover. #WorldHijabDay #StrongInHijab"
3772,2018-01-31 22:18:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Thank the Almighty for everything. Yes, everything. You thank Him not only for all the blessings He has bestowed on you but for the trials, the difficulties and the frustrations that have come your way. They have surely helped you become a better person."
3773,2018-01-31 10:14:45+00:00,muftimenk,Be careful when you blurt out harsh words in harsh tones. The hurt might pierce deeper than you could ever imagine. You probably think a simple sorry can fix it. But think again. Words can leave scars. Some scars are more permanent than others.
3774,2018-01-31 03:53:17+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty is the most Merciful. Even when our faith is weak or lacking, He continues to bless us. He continues to favour us, despite the odds. He will keep doing that for as long as He wishes. That’s the Almighty."
3775,2018-01-30 17:20:45+00:00,muftimenk,Don't go round pretending to be who you’re not. Many people go through life wearing different masks. Remember you can fool others but the Almighty knows the real you. The fake will eventually lose and the real will win over.
3776,2018-01-30 09:08:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When you start your day by making time for the Almighty and spending time with Him, you’ve nothing to fear. Rest assured that He will guide your steps in the path of blessing and victory throughout your day."
3777,2018-01-29 20:23:51+00:00,muftimenk,"You want a better life? Pray. The more you pray, the less you will panic. You’ll see things clearer. The more you worship the Almighty, the less you will worry. You will become a more patient person and you’ll be less pressured by the stress of this world."
3778,2018-01-29 10:03:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. Give us the courage to move forward, the strength to go through our hardships and trials and to have firm faith in You that everything will turn out fine in the end. Aameen."
3779,2018-01-29 05:09:39+00:00,muftimenk,"There is way too much competition in our world today. Few people want to work together and help each other succeed. Instead, we get envious when others do well. This is wrong. It should motivate and make us want to succeed as well."
3780,2018-01-28 07:43:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't hate on people, no matter how much they’ve wronged you. Give generously, no matter how little you have. Forgive those who have hurt you, no matter how hard it is and see how much easier your life becomes."
3781,2018-01-27 21:54:31+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want to feel the beauty of worship, cleanse your heart. Get rid of pride, hatred and anything that gets in the way of being fully focused on the Almighty. It won’t happen overnight but you’ll get there."
3782,2018-01-27 16:40:44+00:00,muftimenk,"You need to understand this. Just as the Almighty opens doors nobody can shut for you, He also shuts doors that nobody can open. So at times, no matter how hard you try or how badly you want something, it just won’t happen."
3783,2018-01-27 03:56:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever the Almighty has decreed for you, no one can stop. If you’re doing your best to stay on His Path, whatever’s meant for you will be yours.  There is no  need to chase after it. It will come to you."
3784,2018-01-26 18:10:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Trust people by all means but don’t go overboard. Remember, there’s no guarantee in life; even the closest people around you may go against you. But as long as you trust the Almighty, He will never let you down. Have patience and you’ll reap the reward."
3785,2018-01-26 05:13:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, help us to understand that life doesn't always go the way we want. You’re the only One who knows what’s best for us. You’re the only One who knows what the future holds. Help us to remain steadfast &amp; face every test with utmost patience."
3786,2018-01-26 02:13:03+00:00,muftimenk,I am always impressed by those who display great character despite their achievements. It makes them even greater. The international cricketer Yusuf Pathan at the Vadodara Airport recently during my transit in India. @iamyusufpathan https://t.co/VsgPIV2VKR
3787,2018-01-25 16:35:18+00:00,muftimenk,"Your faith, like most things in life will fluctuate. Don’t expect it to remain constant. There’ll be ups and downs, highs and lows. Don’t let that define you. Do things sincerely for the sake of the Almighty and your faith will strengthen by His Mercy."
3788,2018-01-25 05:40:15+00:00,muftimenk,Why worry about what people think of you? It really doesn’t matter. Just stay away from grudges and revenge. Work towards keeping a heart full of love instead. It’s not easy but it can be done. Seek your strength form the Almighty and keep your intent pure.
3789,2018-01-24 21:12:23+00:00,muftimenk,"When you’re able to control your tongue, it shows you have matured spiritually. Misuse of the tongue can lead to destruction, sometimes without even realizing it. Learn to let go of unwholesome chats and let only beneficial things come out of your mouth."
3790,2018-01-24 14:07:12+00:00,muftimenk,"You could be experiencing chaos and difficult times in your life but if you seek the Almighty amidst all that uncertainty, you’ll find a sense of peace in your heart because you know nothing is permanent. You know ease is around the corner. Be patient."
3791,2018-01-24 00:08:45+00:00,muftimenk,"Instead of making everything about yourself, learn to be an active listener and allow others to speak for a change. Show you’re interested, lend an ear to hear about their troubles without making any judgement. You’ll be surprised how much you can help someone just by listening."
3792,2018-01-23 12:40:50+00:00,muftimenk,"It's a misconception to think that you cannot start praying and getting close to the Almighty unless you have turned your life around fully. Understand that this is a trick of Satan. Don’t fall for it. No matter what’s going on in your life, pray! Keep praying!"
3793,2018-01-23 03:50:36+00:00,muftimenk,The problem with us is we think our problems will never get better. We lack faith. We lack trust in the Almighty. Has it occurred to us that He already had the solution way before we had the problem?
3794,2018-01-22 21:22:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty never tests you with anything except to help you reach a destination that you ultimately wish to reach, deep down in your hearts. So bear patience and you’ll emerge the winner in all this."
3795,2018-01-22 12:08:51+00:00,muftimenk,"We tend to assume people will always be there for us and we can appreciate them later. What if that later never comes? Don’t take things for granted. Share your feelings, especially with loved ones and those close to you before it’s too late."
3796,2018-01-21 20:53:34+00:00,muftimenk,"Our life is never a straight road. There’ll be detours. There’ll be road blocks; but remember, it’s a journey of faith. Trust the Almighty fully in all conditions. It’s part of our test. Understand His Plan."
3797,2018-01-21 12:49:52+00:00,muftimenk,Don't fall into the trap of Satan who makes you believe that happiness comes with getting all that your heart desires. This is simply not true. Happiness is enjoying all that you have been blessed with.
3798,2018-01-21 06:14:04+00:00,muftimenk,"What you do away from the public eye speaks a lot about you. In fact, it shows your true character. And don’t think no one knows or sees it because the Almighty knows everything about you, both done publicly and in private."
3799,2018-01-20 22:14:42+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, the Almighty gives us so many warning signs yet we totally ignore them, often thinking we know better. Understand His Plan. He is trying to protect us from harm and whatever evil that stands in the way."
3800,2018-01-20 12:27:22+00:00,muftimenk,Stop stressing yourself over how your life is going to turn out. Nobody has it all figured out. No one knows. Only the One who made you knows what will happen. So live your life the best way you can and attach your heart to the One who matters most.
3801,2018-01-19 18:45:11+00:00,muftimenk,Never doubt what the Almighty can do. The Lord of the Worlds knows how to suddenly change things. He can suddenly move people out of your life. He can suddenly open doors you never dreamed would open. He is the Best Planner!
3802,2018-01-19 06:01:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do, don’t fall into this trap. Don’t try to paint an awful picture of someone else in order to paint a perfect picture of yourself. It will come back to haunt you and it won’t be a beautiful sight. Take heed."
3803,2018-01-18 21:10:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The closer you get to the Almighty, the more you will feel His Mercy in your life. You’ll find that your trials and difficulties become easier to handle. You understand His Plan. He will touch the inner depths of your heart with a profound peace."
3804,2018-01-18 09:09:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Before careful of overspending. We break the bank for things which ultimately displease the Almighty. Don’t give in to the whispering of Satan who says you need to live up to a certain lifestyle &amp; reputation. At the end of the day, you’ll end up the loser."
3805,2018-01-17 22:57:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to appreciate the little things in life. They mean a lot. The Almighty has given us so much, more than we need and we take them for granted. We keep wanting more. Constantly think of how blessed we are and never forget to thank Him."
3806,2018-01-17 14:43:25+00:00,muftimenk,"There's no end to what  we want; better car, a bigger house, a better job, more money. The list is endless. Stop for a moment &amp; think. Do we really need all that? Will they make us happy? Ask the Almighty for what’s best. Trust Him to give you what you need most!"
3807,2018-01-17 04:07:49+00:00,muftimenk,"How we comment or react on social media speaks volumes about who we are, how we think and what we stand for. The sad reality is that there are still so many out there who don’t think positively. They think the worst of others and always ready to criticise. Don't be like them."
3808,2018-01-16 21:43:05+00:00,muftimenk,"We often take for granted the people closest to us, especially our parents. May the Almighty always guide us to be respectful and kind to them, no matter what status, position and power we have achieved in life. Remember, how they brought us up when we were young."
3809,2018-01-16 08:28:24+00:00,muftimenk,"When you experience worry or anxiety about anything, know that it’s form Satan. When you fully trust the Almighty with all your affairs, you will let go of such feelings because you know at the end of the day, He only wants what’s best for you."
3810,2018-01-15 18:52:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't get tired of doing what’s right. No matter what others are saying, you must stay on track and uphold the truth. Keep believing, keep praying, keep expecting. Keep going. The Almighty is in full control."
3811,2018-01-15 09:21:07+00:00,muftimenk,"It's easy to pretend you care for a cause but in actual fact you’re too busy with your own life. Talk is cheap. Anyone can talk about promoting awareness but are you actually doing something? Donating, giving your time? The Almighty knows what our hearts reveal &amp; conceal."
3812,2018-01-14 22:45:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Those who want to steal your peace will provoke you till they get the reaction they want. Remember, the best reaction in this case is NO reaction. Don’t give them the attention they want. Keep your peace!"
3813,2018-01-14 10:31:29+00:00,muftimenk,"My Twitter account has overtaken my FB in its following &amp; activity. In order to benefit from FB, you must like &amp; follow the page with priority. Liking, commenting &amp; sharing each post would ensure you don't miss any posts &amp; would also improve the reach so others can benefit too."
3814,2018-01-14 04:52:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty has clearly stated that He will not burden us beyond what we can bear. If we’re unable to cope with the trials, it’s because we have weak faith and we’re not fully trusting Him. When this happens bearing patience becomes difficult!"
3815,2018-01-13 21:59:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't wait to forgive someone till they apologise. You may end up waiting forever. Remember, it’s easy to hold a grudge and it’s easy to lay blame. But by doing so, you’re allowing others to have power over you. For the sake of closure &amp; healing, you should forgive and move on."
3816,2018-01-13 13:58:57+00:00,muftimenk,"When you see the Almighty blessing your friends and neighbours, be happy for them. Each time you see someone else being bestowed with His Blessings, rejoice for them. Remember, if He has done it for them, He will do it for you."
3817,2018-01-13 03:46:58+00:00,muftimenk,"We've all been through rough days, a difficult month or a bad year. But these are often blessings in disguise. Remember, everything the Almighty does is good. We only have to wait patiently, hold our head up and press on. Let life take its course."
3818,2018-01-12 20:14:12+00:00,muftimenk,"What's past is done and gone forever. You can’t go back in time to undo anything. The only thing to do is to go forward, learn from past mistakes and with hindsight, forgive yourself for not knowing better then."

https://t.co/YWtWW331gV"
3820,2018-01-12 08:06:07+00:00,muftimenk,"If and when you’re tempted to speak about someone else’s fault, speak of yours first. Whatever fault you’ve identified in a person,  probably goes to show that the fault is also present in yourself!"
3821,2018-01-12 00:15:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, keep our hearts connected to You. When we’re tempted to sin, let us remember that You’re watching &amp; that the Angels are recording all that we do. Give us the strength to exercise self control &amp; keep us away from the opportunities of sin."
3822,2018-01-11 18:09:20+00:00,muftimenk,"All the prayers you’ve been making, the dreams you’ve been wanting so badly, trust the Almighty because He has got it under control. He is going to ensure that things fall into place. He is going to make things happen that you could never have done on your own."
3823,2018-01-11 07:51:44+00:00,muftimenk,"If you’re constantly edgy, always complaining about the slightest thing, low on tolerance and upset with people around you, be wary. These are signs of weak faith. Patience and tolerance are the hallmarks of a believer."
3824,2018-01-11 01:19:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Life is such that there’ll be happiness and sadness. Keep moving even when things are not going your way, even when you’re hurting; because you’ll never know what is waiting for you round the corner. The Almighty works His miracles in the most unexpected ways!"
3825,2018-01-10 18:23:40+00:00,muftimenk,"It's important to know when to let go. Sometimes things, situations or people don’t serve any meaningful purpose anymore. It’s the Almighty’s way of telling you it’s time for the next phase. Read the signs and move on."
3826,2018-01-10 10:24:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, when the sun is out, many will claim to be your friend and want to be a part of your life. But the minute thunderstorms occur, check out who actually remains by your side. There won’t be many but they are your true friends."
3827,2018-01-09 20:56:13+00:00,muftimenk,"You've been spending hours in worship and no matter how much you’ve been asking, there seems to be no response. Don’t get frustrated or impatient. The wait, the pain and the struggle will be worth it when the Almighty grants you ease. It will come."
3828,2018-01-09 04:10:39+00:00,muftimenk,Don't dismiss those with special needs as worthless. The Almighty made them that way for a reason. They’re just different. It doesn’t mean they are worthless. Be kind to them. Help them. Go out of your way to appreciate them. Make them feel special.
3829,2018-01-08 16:59:36+00:00,muftimenk,It's easy to keep hanging on to the past and feel self pity for what has happened. That’s a waste of time and energy. Start moving forward. Leave the baggage behind. Believe in yourself and trust the Almighty to make things happen.
3830,2018-01-08 09:38:03+00:00,muftimenk,"We are all facing some kind of difficulties. But stand firm in faith, knowing that the Almighty will turn things around. Perhaps not today or tomorrow but it will happen. Your trial won’t last. It will come to pass."
3831,2018-01-07 21:41:57+00:00,muftimenk,"Most people will have an agenda. They can’t bear the thought of you doing well. But don’t forget, they don’t know what the Almighty knows. He knows what you’re capable of. He knows your potential. Don’t let others tell you otherwise."
3832,2018-01-07 13:46:58+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let negative thoughts breed in your mind. Often we think of ‘what ifs’ and scenarios and worry ourselves for no apparent reason. That’s exactly what Satan wants. Learn to have faith and trust the Almighty instead.
3833,2018-01-06 22:47:17+00:00,muftimenk,Life’s too short to waste valuable time with the wrong company. Surround yourself with those who will draw you closer to the Almighty. Those who will challenge you to greater heights and to be better human beings.
3834,2018-01-06 12:59:22+00:00,muftimenk,"Be careful what you take away from social media. Depending on your outlook and attitude, you may end up with a ridiculous, fictitious life that so many people end up living. May the Almighty grant us an awareness and protect us all."
3835,2018-01-05 21:45:15+00:00,muftimenk,"When you strive to worship your Maker, late in the night as the rest of the world sleeps,
When you give generously even though you don't have much,
When you worship Him promptly even though you have a busy schedule, it shows you're truly loved by the Almighty."
3836,2018-01-05 10:44:53+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let people make you feel bad for not conforming to their way of life and habits. You’re answerable to the Almighty for all your actions. You don’t have time to accommodate other people’s demands.
3837,2018-01-05 02:55:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, purify our hearts of any resentment towards others. Help us to always be aware and conscious of You and to realise that our life is temporary and short. Help us appreciate the value of time and to be aware of how precious and fleeting it is!"
3838,2018-01-04 14:42:14+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how difficult your life has been all this while, know that the Almighty has things planned for you. With Him on your side, you should move forward with confidence. Your best days are out there waiting for you!"
3839,2018-01-04 02:44:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan will always distract us during  worship. He whispers into our hearts, plays with our minds and makes us recall things which we never thought of before that. Understand his plot when you find your mind straying."
3840,2018-01-03 17:28:06+00:00,muftimenk,"As life gets more hectic &amp; stressful, people have less time for each other. That’s the sad reality. But how often has the Almighty reminded us that He is near. Never think you’re alone. You’re not.  Turn to Him for anything and everything."
3841,2018-01-03 09:30:52+00:00,muftimenk,Keep your relationship with your Maker private. There’s no need to show off to others how pious you are. Nobody knows your struggle but Him. Nobody knows the temptations that come your way but Him. So keep striving. Keep going.
3842,2018-01-03 02:10:53+00:00,muftimenk,"When your heart is filled with patience, no matter what the Almighty tests you with, the reward is beyond your imagination. The reward for your endurance, for accepting the outcome, no matter what He has chosen for you and the reward for having faith!"
3843,2018-01-02 15:05:05+00:00,muftimenk,"When people misunderstand and reject you, don’t feel miserable and depressed. It’s part of the Almighty’s plan to make you realize that you shouldn’t rely on His creation but only on the One who created you."
3844,2018-01-01 22:56:57+00:00,muftimenk,Don't make the mistake of telling someone too much about yourself. Over sharing is bad. It can invite negative energy and vibes from those who don’t want good for you. Share only with those who have proven they truly care.
3845,2018-01-01 15:12:33+00:00,muftimenk,"My good friend trying to win me over but I remain loyal to my cause...looooool. Football fans become very emotional when they see us siding with any team apart from theirs...

3846,2018-01-01 12:45:28+00:00,muftimenk,Try and do something each day to bring a smile on your parents face.  Show them the love and appreciation that they deserve for all they've done for you. Don't be among those who neglect them and see their worth only after they have left  this world.
3847,2018-01-01 02:00:25+00:00,muftimenk,People always talk about following their dream. They make their dreams and desires the centre of their lives. Ensure that the dream you’re following doesn’t take you away from the Almighty. Don’t ever do it at the expense of His Will.
3848,2017-12-31 19:23:49+00:00,muftimenk,"If you have a good heart, thank the Almighty.  Don't ever regret it. You may be let down by people and you’ll be disappointed but no matter what happens, you’ll end up the winner. He knows and sees everything."
3849,2017-12-31 08:13:32+00:00,muftimenk,"There are those who, no matter what you say or do, will never admit that they’re wrong. They’ll make it seem like it’s all your fault. Recognize this quality in people and keep away from them."
3850,2017-12-30 15:53:39+00:00,muftimenk,Nothing in your life happens randomly. The Almighty knows what He is doing to help you return to Him in the best way possible. You have to trust His Plan. He has planned it right to the last detail!
3851,2017-12-30 07:06:47+00:00,muftimenk,All that you’re going through won’t matter one day. That one day ..when everything stops and all that matters is how you lived your life. So don’t wait till you’re older to do good and be kind and to get closer to the Almighty. Don’t procrastinate. Do it now.
3852,2017-12-29 19:23:24+00:00,muftimenk,"If the Almighty has chosen to guide you, be thankful. Remember, He guides whom He wills and it’s His Mercy that has enveloped you. Thank Him. Don’t look down on those who have deviated from His path. He can change their situation any time!"
3853,2017-12-29 09:50:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, make us better people today than we were yesterday. Help us win the fight between desire and discipline so we may get closer to you. Help us let go of toxic, negative people from our lives so we may grow into positive and grateful people."
3854,2017-12-29 01:27:28+00:00,muftimenk,"Always start your day with prayer. It will set you on the right course and really helps you cope better with unexpected things that may occur. And don’t forget to end it with prayer too, for no one knows if you’ll wake to another day."
3855,2017-12-28 13:53:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to view your hardships differently. See every adversity, every disappointment in a new light. They’re not meant to defeat you but to draw you closer to the Almighty. They’re there to make you a better person."
3856,2017-12-28 04:53:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't make your fiends more important than your family. Some people are so good to those outside their homes but treat their family members badly; with abusive talk and action. If that’s the case, you’ve lost credibility with the Almighty!"
3857,2017-12-27 21:04:16+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is there are people who will hate you if you’re doing well and they’ll hate you if you’re not. So whatever it is, don’t pay attention to them. You’re not alone in dealing with such people. Remember, insecure people put others down to raise themselves."

3859,2017-12-27 06:39:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of the company you keep. They could be the cause of your unhappiness. If they’re overly focused on appearance, trappings of this world &amp; social media, you could slowly be drawing yourself away from what should be the centre of your life, the Almighty."
3860,2017-12-26 22:51:30+00:00,muftimenk,"Amidst the hardship &amp; difficulties, you can still be a beacon of hope for someone. Never doubt that. Extend a helping hand, a smile, a meal for the hungry... you can be their miracle!"
3861,2017-12-26 06:05:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Each and everyone of us matters to the Almighty. He knows all there is to know about us; the good, the bad; the ugly. He created us. He cares about us. He loves us more than we could ever imagine. The whole world may be against us but He is for us."
3862,2017-12-25 23:13:36+00:00,muftimenk,"When you stain your tongue with slander, backbiting and gossip, your spirituality goes down significantly. You may think you’re harming the other person but in actual fact, you’re harming yourself. So learn to hold your tongue because it has the power of life and death!"
3863,2017-12-25 12:48:04+00:00,muftimenk,"Our attitude towards time shows our attitude towards the value of life. Remember, time is a gift from the Almighty. What we do with time is what we do with our lives. Every moment that passes by is an opportunity gone, used or abused, never to return."
3864,2017-12-25 00:25:12+00:00,muftimenk,"During #Christmas each year many people ask if #Muslims truly love #Jesus. Yes we do. To be a true Muslim one must love Jesus.  May Peace Be Upon Him.

3865,2017-12-24 16:47:01+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't wish ill on those who have harmed you. Instead, pray for them to acknowledge their mistakes and be guided. Don’t worry about revenge. The Almighty teaches us lessons we’re meant to learn at the right time. He is always with the one who’s right and fair!"
3866,2017-12-24 09:04:33+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty is the Owner of Everything. He never runs out of favour. His Resources are limitless. The fact that He blesses someone abundantly won’t stop Him from doing the same for others.
3867,2017-12-23 21:43:26+00:00,muftimenk,"If you've been blessed with more in this life, find ways to give it back to those who need it more. Do understand the Almighty’s Plan. He did not bless you just so you can sit on what you have. He showed you a favour so you could go ahead and create ease for others."
3868,2017-12-23 08:36:08+00:00,muftimenk,"As much as the Almighty opens doors for us, He also closes them. When that happens, it takes a mature mind to say, ""I don't understand it, but I'm not going to get upset because He knows what’s good for me. I shall accept it. I trust Him fully.”"

3870,2017-12-22 14:08:43+00:00,muftimenk,"When you believe and trust that the Almighty has your back no matter what you’re going through, that’s faith! That’s when life becomes more peaceful &amp; less stressful because you know He will get you through the good times and bad times in life."
3871,2017-12-22 09:41:24+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, we ask You to protect and guide us every step of the way. Keep our hearts firmly attached to You, no matter what we’re going through.  Elevate our status in Paradise so we may be in the company of the righteous."
3872,2017-12-21 19:53:08+00:00,muftimenk,"In the course of our lives, some things are not going to make sense, but that’s okay. Rest easy knowing that the Almighty wouldn’t have allowed it if He wasn’t going to bring good out of it. Don’t doubt that. He always has our best interest at heart."
3873,2017-12-21 07:41:55+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how bad your day is going, you have no excuse to treat others badly. Check yourself now because it’s wrong and needs to stop. Don’t be the cause of someone else’s suffering and misery. Be the better person and always treat others the way you’d like to be treated."

3875,2017-12-20 15:06:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Forgiveness is not only about others. It’s also about our own spiritual growth. Love and forgiveness cannot be separated. If we choose to live the way the Almighty wants us to, then forgiving is an option that cannot be avoided. Because we all sin, we should forgive others."
3876,2017-12-20 09:29:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Let us be honest with ourselves. We all do foolish things from time to time. We do things we know we shouldn’t but nothing we do is beyond the Almighty’s everlasting Mercy. Remember, we may make mistakes, but He doesn’t."
3877,2017-12-20 00:31:00+00:00,muftimenk,Don't let anger control you. Don't let hate breed in your heart. Don't let negativity be the order of your day. Keep your heart guided in the right direction. Keep the Almighty at the centre of your life and you'll live a life of passion and purpose.
3878,2017-12-19 10:29:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't belittle the one who remains silent. Not only can it be more powerful than words, it also takes a lot of maturity, effort and intelligence to keep quiet when you’re expected to respond in the same way you were spoken to. It’s a powerful tool to learn and master."
3879,2017-12-18 21:58:20+00:00,muftimenk,"When you finally see your reward in Paradise for all the pain you endured in the temporary world, you’d wish you had more of the pain at that time! No one knows what awaits us for what we used to do but the Almighty. So keep going."
3880,2017-12-18 16:57:09+00:00,muftimenk,"Remember, the Almighty’s Mercy and Forgiveness surpass anything you can imagine. So don’t think of giving up each time you fall back into sin. Instead, think of why you should start over and try again. You’ll get there!"
3881,2017-12-18 06:50:59+00:00,muftimenk,"As the year draws to an end and the holiday season is upon us, let us be mindful of others, be extra careful on the roads, courteous and patient while travelling and most of all, seize the opportunity to spend some quality time with loved ones. Happy Holidays!
#HappyHolidays"
3882,2017-12-17 20:01:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Our lives can end in a heartbeat. The Almighty can take us anytime. It has nothing to do with age. Young or old, when it’s your time, you’ll go. Be prepared. Don’t be caught up in this world with never-ending desires."
3883,2017-12-17 14:49:58+00:00,muftimenk,"The Prophet Muhammad pbuh specifically prohibited attacking places of worship belonging to people of other faiths. Those who perpetrate such crimes do not represent Islam, but their own deviated agendas. #QuettaChurchAttack"
3884,2017-12-17 09:37:02+00:00,muftimenk,"You may have been overlooked by people in your life, passed over for a job promotion, or just treated badly and ignored by some. Don’t worry. These things happen when you’re dealing with people. But know that the Almighty won’t ever overlook you."
3885,2017-12-16 23:09:20+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what you’re going through in life, learn to put your trust in the Almighty. Confess to Him, confide in Him, cry to Him, plead with Him. Bit by bit your life will change. This world will matter less to you. You’ll get closer to Him."
3886,2017-12-16 14:17:58+00:00,muftimenk,"Loss is never easy. Loss of a loved one, loss of wealth, loss of a job. All these can break your heart. But don’t let it make you lose hope in the Mercy of the Almighty. Your heart will heal; it will soften. You’ll draw closer to Him. You’ll feel whole again."
3887,2017-12-16 00:26:55+00:00,muftimenk,"Never forget that the Almighty is on our side. If we take a single step towards Him, He takes many “steps” towards us! Yes, life is hard &amp; unfortunate things happen to us. Often we don’t know why they happen. But trust Him &amp; know that He wants good for us."
3888,2017-12-15 15:56:36+00:00,muftimenk,We've all had problems that we believe will never be solved because it has been too long. We feel bogged down by our own shortcomings. We begin to accept that this is how it's always going to be. But know that the Almighty doesn’t give up on you just because you’ve given up.
3889,2017-12-15 07:00:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, we pray that you have Mercy on us all; take away the suffering and bring on the recovery. We know there is no cure but Your cure. Heal our heart and purify our soul so we can feel a strong attachment to You."
3890,2017-12-14 19:54:24+00:00,muftimenk,"If the Almighty has first place in your life, you won't have to worry about who has the other places. Everything will fall into place and your heart will be content. That’s all that matters eventually."
3891,2017-12-14 03:01:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When you want to correct others, you have to find a way to emotionally reach them. Sometimes when you give advice, people become more aggressive &amp; even worse off than they were before you gave them advice, just because of the way you did it. Use the kindest words &amp; be sincere!"
3892,2017-12-13 13:53:10+00:00,muftimenk,"Never say you have nothing to give. You always have something to give. It may not look like much to you, but to the Almighty, it is far better than a gift from among the wealthiest around you!"
3893,2017-12-13 06:17:53+00:00,muftimenk,The Almighty may test you to see if you’re really true to your word or do you just pay lip service. Do your actions speak as loud as your words? Practise what you preach and He will raise you in status.
3894,2017-12-12 22:05:48+00:00,muftimenk,"Be wary of arrogance. Only the humble can get close to the Almighty and realise that they’re nothing without Him. The minute arrogance takes  root in your heart, a barrier forms. A barrier between you &amp; your Creator. Humble yourself for Him and He will raise you."
3895,2017-12-12 09:59:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Many of us are guilty of overthinking. Remember, the battle starts in your mind. Don’t defeat yourself in your own mind before you’ve even started. Focus your mind in the right direction. Be positive about things. You will see the difference."
3896,2017-12-11 21:37:41+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't panic, don’t be frustrated, don’t worry. You’re exactly where the Almighty wants you to be at this point in time. Whatever you’ve experienced so far is all part of His Divine Plan. It will shape and mould you into the person you’re meant to be."
3897,2017-12-11 12:09:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Be humble always. Don’t let arrogance creep into your heart. Respect people around you. Each day, try to make an impact on people who cross your path. Try to be a source of inspiration to others. Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring."
3898,2017-12-10 20:20:25+00:00,muftimenk,"When you find it hardest to forgive the one who has wronged you, that’s when you should really try to do so. It could be the most loved act by the Almighty that will take you to Paradise on the Day of Judgement!"
3899,2017-12-10 05:50:32+00:00,muftimenk,"Satan never tires of all the whispering, plotting and planning against us. As long as we have the slightest doubt, he is succeeding. That’s why we should never stop remembering the Almighty  to protect us from all of Satan's evils."
3900,2017-12-09 21:20:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Be strong. Stay firm in faith. Face whatever the Almighty has decreed head on. Seek His Help &amp; Protection always. Don’t worry about what others say. When you come to the end of your life, you’re not going to answer to people, you’re going to answer to Him Alone!"
3901,2017-12-09 12:58:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Nothing is guaranteed in this life, except death. So don’t delay asking for forgiveness. Each night, before you go to bed, clear your slate with the Almighty. You’ll never know if you will live to see the next day."
3902,2017-12-09 04:28:11+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter what’s happening in your life right now, no matter how bleak things look, anything is possible as long as you seek the Almighty with a sincere heart. He will make things happen which your limited mind could never comprehend. He will respond &amp; that is His Promise."
3903,2017-12-08 21:54:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't wish ill on others. It can come back to you in the most unimaginable way. Always want good for people &amp; you’ll end up being blessed. Cultivate a good heart. Purify your thoughts. Remember, the Almighty loves those who do good."
3904,2017-12-08 10:58:00+00:00,muftimenk,"Making a false statement doesn't change the reality. No matter what people say, the truth will prevail. The Almighty has a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle. Pray hard. Don’t give up!"
3905,2017-12-08 00:10:17+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, we pray for those in need. Those with broken hearts and broken lives. Bless them with healing. Change their circumstances. Help them make sense of all the chaos going on round them."
3906,2017-12-07 18:29:07+00:00,muftimenk,"May the Almighty protect those in occupied lands, grant them ease amidst interference from foreign influence and keep them safe. Ultimately, it’s the Almighty who will solve all our problems."
3907,2017-12-07 06:34:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When we ask the Almighty for something, we should do so with trust and certainty that He will answer it. Never should we supplicate with a lazy mind &amp; distracted heart. Ask wholeheartedly.  Keep asking. Be patient and don’t give up."
3908,2017-12-06 19:37:44+00:00,muftimenk,"The root of all diseases of the heart is our love and attachment to this materialistic world. We know this world is temporary, yet we find it so hard to disengage from it. May the Almighty guide our hearts into desiring what is lasting - the Hereafter."
3909,2017-12-06 14:24:17+00:00,muftimenk,"We often trust the worldly things around us, our wealth, a hefty pay check, a lifestyle of excess. We forget that all this can be swept away in the blink of an eye, leaving us with nothing. But if we trust the Almighty,  He will see us through the toughest of times!"
3910,2017-12-05 20:58:05+00:00,muftimenk,"Society will always pressure you into being this or that. We are brainwashed daily into believing it. Each one has his or her opinion. That’s okay. Deep down in your heart, you know who you are. Don’t let people pressure you into becoming something you’re not."
3911,2017-12-05 06:42:59+00:00,muftimenk,"When you want to give advice, do so in such a way that people want to listen to you. Don’t be mean and hurtful. Be genuine in wanting to correct their ways and help them get back on track. Your sincerity will long be remembered."
3912,2017-12-04 22:54:26+00:00,muftimenk,Stay away from empty chatter and useless talk. There’s no need to show off or put others down when you’re in conversation.
3913,2017-12-04 15:56:20+00:00,muftimenk,"The more successful you are, the more humble you should be. Don’t try to show your greatness because greatness belongs to the Almighty Alone. Recognise this. Submit to Him and show humility. You’ll earn closeness to Him and His special Mercy!"
3914,2017-12-04 05:28:21+00:00,muftimenk,"When making decisions, be guided by what is permissible and your heart will be at ease. Don't feel bad about making decisions that may upset some people. You're answerable to your Creator not His Creation!"
3915,2017-12-03 22:41:18+00:00,muftimenk,Always remind yourself of your purpose in life. Never leave the Almighty out of the equation. And think of death often too. It will humble you and soften your heart. And reminds you not to be sad about worldly matters. Remember this life is temporary. It will come to an end!
3916,2017-12-03 14:01:29+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever it is that you want, ask the Almighty. Your whole life can change with supplication. That’s the most powerful tool you have. Use it. Don’t waste it. It can change your fate. Only He can give you what you want. And you’ll be rewarded just for asking!"
3917,2017-12-03 05:59:36+00:00,muftimenk,"When you speak ill of others behind their backs, you’re backbiting. Be wary. What they are and who they are, shouldn’t be matters of concern to you.  Just stay away from this bad habit and you’re working your way towards Paradise!"
3918,2017-12-02 20:46:53+00:00,muftimenk,"The Almighty Alone knows the pain, sadness and emptiness felt on the loss of a loved one. This is why He has taken it upon Himself to reward such patience. Nobody else would understand but Him. Bear patience."
3919,2017-12-02 14:22:50+00:00,muftimenk,"Some judge others because it gives them a sense of prestige; demeaning others can also create a false sense of security. Remember,  people are all different. No two persons are completely alike. Accept these differences &amp; stop judging others. It’s a hurtful &amp; sinful act."
3920,2017-12-02 05:18:05+00:00,muftimenk,"It's human nature to get frustrated at times. When that happens, the best thing to do is to take a step back from whatever situation you’re in, confide in the Almighty and give Him complete control!"
3921,2017-12-01 22:41:37+00:00,muftimenk,"When you submit fully to the Almighty, don’t be surprised if He tests you with tough times and challenges. These are the things that bring you closer to Him. Show Him sincerely that you’re worthy of His Paradise!"
3922,2017-12-01 14:37:46+00:00,muftimenk,"Being happy for others will not rob you of your own happiness. When someone has more than you, it doesn’t mean they’re getting your share of the blessing. What’s yours will be yours. The Almighty will see to that. Always wish the best for others!"
3923,2017-12-01 05:50:08+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed day, remove worldliness from our hearts &amp; envy of what others have. Help us to be grateful &amp; not to attach our hearts to more material things. Protect us from the tricks of Satan, who will keep luring us to the pleasures &amp; desires of this world."
3924,2017-11-30 18:05:16+00:00,muftimenk,"No matter how you look at it, when you speak ill of others, you’ll be on the losing end. All that time spent in sinful conversation could be converted into good deeds, if the same amount of time was used in remembering the Almighty."
3925,2017-11-30 05:52:30+00:00,muftimenk,"What you show of yourself, in front of others for the world to see, should be no different from the way you live your life away from the public glare. If you have a different set of rules behind closed doors, then you have a problem that needs to be addressed."
3926,2017-11-29 22:18:25+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to mange your time wisely &amp; get closer to the Almighty. When you get up in the middle of the night while everyone is sleeping, you’re telling the Almighty that He matters. Remember,  ultimately we will all return to Him so spend your time wisely to build your Hereafter."
3927,2017-11-29 13:11:49+00:00,muftimenk,"Talking about others is not always gossip, but when the talk turns negative, that’s when you have to be careful. Look for ways to bring it back on track, back to being positive. And be sure you’re not belittling others."
3928,2017-11-29 03:34:23+00:00,muftimenk,Let people backbite and spread rumours about you. There’s not much you can do anyway. But thank the Almighty because they’re giving away their good deeds to you. Be at ease knowing you’ll be rewarded for it.
3929,2017-11-28 20:32:54+00:00,muftimenk,"If you think you can make yourself great by making someone else look small, think again. Don’t ever belittle anyone. Remember, if you can’t help them, at least don’t hurt them or make them feel worthless. Give those you meet their due respect."
3930,2017-11-28 03:42:18+00:00,muftimenk,"One of the greatest gifts you can give others is kindness. If someone is in need, extend a helping hand. Don't do it only for the ones you like &amp; respect - that’s easy. But do it for those you don’t even know. That’s a tall order &amp; it shows the true state of your heart!"
3931,2017-11-27 16:27:07+00:00,muftimenk,"When people are quiet, don’t label them as snobbish or arrogant. They could be hiding their pain and prefer not to talk about it. There’s a story behind every person, a reason why they are the way they are. That’s why it’s so important to be kind."
3932,2017-11-27 04:03:13+00:00,muftimenk,"The sad truth about many today is that they want to be someone else. With social media, nobody is happy with who they are. They compare themselves to false images, mostly photoshopped. It’s time to stop pretending. You’re NOT the person you claim to be online!"
3933,2017-11-26 20:52:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Truthfulness is a rare commodity these days. So many people don’t want the truth. They’re happy in their comfort zone. They’re willing to tolerate all kinds of lies and wouldn’t do anything to change it. Remember, we will be answerable to the Almighty when the time comes!"
3934,2017-11-26 07:42:23+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't be the negative mind that takes to social media when it is bored; spreading hate, doubt, speculation, falsehood, disunity and negativity. Instead, be the positive mind that spreads goodness, no matter what the circumstances; even in the face of negativity."
3935,2017-11-25 21:17:21+00:00,muftimenk,Being able to forgive the one who wronged you and being ready to trust him again are two different things. Don’t let others manipulate you to feeling guilty because you’re not ready to trust again. Seek guidance from the Almighty. He’s All-Knowing.
3936,2017-11-25 07:25:56+00:00,muftimenk,"Don't waste your time worrying, especially about things beyond your control. Don’t let worry take away your joy. Instead, use that same energy to thank the Almighty for all that you have. Thank Him for being in control."
3937,2017-11-24 22:47:22+00:00,muftimenk,Devastating news of the attack in #Egypt. Targeting worshippers takes this to a whole new level. My heart goes out to them. May the Almighty grant Mercy to all involved as well as families and victims of this senseless act.
3938,2017-11-24 15:44:19+00:00,muftimenk,"Always have your feet firmly planted on the ground and stay humble. Don’t look down on others, no matter how less well-off they appear. Remember, the one you look down on today might be the person you have to look up to tomorrow. Such is life!"
3939,2017-11-24 10:09:22+00:00,muftimenk,Congratulations to our newly appointed President Cde Emmerson #Mnangagwa. We pray that the Almighty guide you to make the best decisions for the people of #Zimbabwe. We pray for a turnaround in the economy and  positive growth in all spheres of life. #freshstart #Zimbabwe https://t.co/SKDepfrmV5
3940,2017-11-24 03:05:11+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, help us to be generous with our prayers. For those we know &amp; those we don’t. We pray for those who are hurting &amp; going through the hardest of times. We pray for the sick, the injured &amp; the oppressed. Keep everyone safe, under Your protection."
3941,2017-11-23 23:06:59+00:00,muftimenk,Don't be overly dependent on others. People will disappoint you again and again. Start relying on the Almighty. See how He brings people who can enrich you into your life. Trust His Plan and see how your life changes.
3942,2017-11-23 16:09:05+00:00,muftimenk,"The truth is no matter how lonely you are, you’re never alone. The Almighty is always near. Very near. He knows what you’re going through. He is aware of everything. So when everyone has abandoned you, seek comfort in Him, knowing that He is always there."
3943,2017-11-23 03:49:35+00:00,muftimenk,Life can be difficult at times. The never ending running around &amp; stress to get things done. Don’t let it make you resent your life. Learn to look at those who have less than you. Those who would trade places with you at the drop of a hat. Thank the Almighty for everything!
3944,2017-11-22 20:27:35+00:00,muftimenk,"Do you think the Almighty isn’t aware of the nights you cried yourself to sleep, for every time you endured any pain? Do you think all that will go unnoticed and unrewarded? Remember, every trial you pass with patience is a ticket to a better Hereafter."
3945,2017-11-22 03:58:20+00:00,muftimenk,Don’t keep asking why bad things happen to good people. The Almighty has promised us that we will all be tested. He puts us through tests because He knows when you’re at your lowest that you’re most likely to get closer to Him.
3946,2017-11-21 17:54:39+00:00,muftimenk,"A peaceful end to the events in #Zimbabwe over the last few days, with the resignation of the President. Top marks to the defence force for a job well done. We continue to pray for peace, stability and growth."
3947,2017-11-21 14:06:22+00:00,muftimenk,We have all experienced a broken heart. But we don’t have to be imprisoned by the pain. We can hide the suffering from others but not the One who made us. Call out to the Almighty who understands our hearts even better than we do.
3948,2017-11-21 05:20:43+00:00,muftimenk,"When you're on the right track, Satan will attack you even more.  His whisperings aim to mess up your mind &amp; make you doubt. Stand strong because with the Almighty, you’re on the winning side!"
3949,2017-11-20 22:13:13+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever you do in life, remember to always stay within the limits set by the Almighty. Whatever you may achieve without these limits becomes a sin. It’s temporary &amp; short lived. It will never be worth it in the end."
3950,2017-11-20 12:49:43+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever good you do, keep it private between you and the Almighty. Never forget that He holds the key to Paradise, not people around you. People will talk and blemish whatever you do. Let them judge. The Almighty is All-Knowing."
3951,2017-11-20 03:03:26+00:00,muftimenk,"Whatever good you do will come back to you in one way or another. When you help someone else go higher in life, the Almighty will send someone to help you go higher. Good begets good. That’s how it works!"
3952,2017-11-19 21:36:09+00:00,muftimenk,"When serving people, we can’t  afford to be selfish. The wisest decisions are those made knowing what’s going on around you. Peace, stability and positive growth cannot be achieved when we think of ourselves only."
3953,2017-11-19 06:47:49+00:00,muftimenk,"If you want positive change, check your actions &amp; what you’re doing about them. There’s no way you can expect change by sitting around &amp; blaming others or the Almighty. What are the same things you’ve always done over &amp; over that have made you stuck in a rut? Start changing them."
3954,2017-11-18 21:20:01+00:00,muftimenk,"In our ever-connected world where we’re being bombarded with too much information, learn to disconnect and seek inner focus. It’s especially important to control distractions when you’re plugging in with the Almighty! Fight the urge to be connected at all times!"
3955,2017-11-18 14:35:07+00:00,muftimenk,Treat people the way you want  to be treated and pay more attention to those who really go out of their way for you. Don’t let a good heart give up on you. Remember a heart doesn’t turn cold unless it’s been ignored for a while. Good people are getting less common these days!
3956,2017-11-18 08:34:59+00:00,muftimenk,"As #Zimbabwe goes through the most interesting times in its history, we pray for peace and goodness. May the Almighty grant us the best possible outcome. #freshstart https://t.co/aQ9lt5Nrsw"
3957,2017-11-18 06:10:07+00:00,muftimenk,"Always have kind words for others. Be a positive influence, motivate and empower people rather than pick on the negative always. Compliment them and mean it. Be sincere. Your words can impact others years form now."
3958,2017-11-17 21:01:45+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone hurts you, don’t retaliate. Instead, tell yourself you’ll never stoop that low and do the same thing to anyone else. Above all, choose not to live with the guilt of hurting others."
3959,2017-11-17 15:35:51+00:00,muftimenk,"Learn to see beyond the superficial &amp; what’s on the surface; outer beauty, skin colour, material things &amp; the likes. May the Almighty rid our hearts of all the bitter hatred &amp; grudges &amp; help us embrace people as our neighbours for His Sake."
3960,2017-11-17 03:13:03+00:00,muftimenk,"Almighty. On this blessed Friday, give us the courage to confront our weakness and the conviction to stay firm to our faith, despite the chaos in the world today. Reassure our hearts that Your everlasting Mercy will see us through &amp; it will all be okay in the end."
3961,2017-11-16 21:15:10+00:00,muftimenk,"The more wealth you accumulate, the higher the likelihood that you’ll become preoccupied with this world, neglecting your link with your Maker. You may also become addicted to the wealth. Disease of the heart such as bragging &amp; showing off may then result!"
3962,2017-11-16 12:02:36+00:00,muftimenk,"Anger if not guarded can possess, consume, and ultimately destroy a person. How often have we seen or heard of someone who ruined his life because of a rash act or statement made in a fit of rage? So be careful before you unleash words or actions which may cause deep regret."
3963,2017-11-16 03:40:08+00:00,muftimenk,"You may think it was a small act of kindness. But the Almighty does not forget the good you do, the pain you relieved in someone else.

3967,2017-11-14 17:32:46+00:00,muftimenk,Breaking a promise is a serious sin. It's a sin that sows the seed of hypocrisy in the heart of the one who commits it. Some are in the habit of doing this often. Don’t take it lightly. They’ll be raised with the hypocrites on the Day of Judgment!
3968,2017-11-14 05:42:26+00:00,muftimenk,"There'll be hardship &amp; struggle just like there’s happiness &amp; ease. It’s the nature of this life. Don’t let the difficult times consume you.

3973,2017-11-12 03:50:54+00:00,muftimenk,"Avoid gossip at all costs. It’s a rumour &amp; fabrication of the truth; a despicable act that can totally bring a person down. If you’re the target of rumours, don’t retaliate. Stay calm. The person who started the rumour will eventually hurt his own reputation in the process."
3974,2017-11-11 20:26:59+00:00,muftimenk,"At times, the Almighty puts you through hard times because He knows when you’re at your lowest, you’re most likely to turn to Him for comfort, knowing He’s the only One who can change your condition.

3978,2017-11-10 18:00:39+00:00,muftimenk,"Don’t feel like you have to fit in &amp; do what everyone else is doing; what society dictates of you. Stop letting others decide for you. At the end of the day, it’s your journey &amp; yours alone. Walk it with humility."
3979,2017-11-10 10:17:35+00:00,muftimenk,"There will always be someone who’s taller, richer, better-looking with a better job and so on.

3982,2017-11-09 10:59:18+00:00,muftimenk,"How Merciful is the Almighty! When you commit a sin, it’s recorded as one sin. If you intend to do a good deed but end up not doing it, it’s still recorded as one good deed. When you actually do it, it’s recorded as ten!"
3983,2017-11-09 03:20:49+00:00,muftimenk,"When someone disagrees with us or somehow makes our life difficult, remember that it’s often not about us. It may be about their pain or struggle or whatever they’re going through. Give them the benefit of the doubt."

4136,2017-09-07 14:42:07+00:00,muftimenk,One of the biggest tests is if you're able to keep it humble even when you have much. Sacrifice in His cause. He'll give you even more.

4140,2017-09-05 21:15:19+00:00,muftimenk,A silent prayer from a pure heart is more meaningful for a cause you support than getting a huge number of likes for it on social media.
4141,2017-09-05 12:55:19+00:00,muftimenk,Almighty. Grant ease to the #Rohingya &amp; their suffering. Only You can get them out of the oppression. We keep praying for their safety.

4144,2017-09-04 14:24:04+00:00,muftimenk,Those who show real patience are most dear to the Almighty. Giving up is not in their vocabulary. They struggle &amp; strive for His sake.
4145,2017-09-04 07:28:37+00:00,muftimenk,"The problem with us is we're impatient. We always demand answers, wanting things to make sense now. The Almighty is All-Knowing. Trust Him."

4438,2017-05-02 22:14:51+00:00,muftimenk,"When you strive in the way of the Almighty, you don't worry about being accepted or having the approval of others. You know your priority."

4440,2017-05-01 23:57:15+00:00,muftimenk,There's beauty in pain. We connect better with the Almighty when we're in pain than when we're content. That's how He draws us closer.
4441,2017-05-01 12:54:37+00:00,muftimenk,Fame like many things can be good if used properly. But it can also destroy you because Satan is good at messing with your egos. Be wary.
4442,2017-04-30 23:12:46+00:00,muftimenk,At times we can't control how our heart feels. It can weigh us down like a heavy burden. Ask Him to ease the feeling. He will grant peace.
4443,2017-04-30 03:51:09+00:00,muftimenk,How strange life is. The rich aren't satisfied. The poor desire to get rich. Attach your heart to your Maker &amp; none of this will matter.

4499,2017-04-04 04:05:40+00:00,muftimenk,How you react when tested says a lot about you. Does the pain make you angry? Do you take it out on others? Remember pain  is part of life.
